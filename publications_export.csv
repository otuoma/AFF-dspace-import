12520,Communication and knowledge management at AFF: Achievements made in 2017,Forests and forestry continue to be very much profiled on the global agenda and their relevance to other sectors of national economies is increasingly been recognized and appreciated. This progress report is developed within the framework of the overarching communications and knowledge management strategies designed to communicate the identity and value of AFFs mandated role in providing a platform for the networking and interchange of forest related information among the many stakeholders in African forestry. This report is on progress made on implementing activities in the year 2017 by the Communications and Knowledge Management Unit of AFF.,African Forest Forum (AFF),2017,Report,20381,5/2/2018 14:25,https://afforum.org/oldaff/sites/default/files/English/English_165.pdf,
12521,Mobilising stakeholders in Africa towards sustainable forest management: An assessment of efforts made by the African Forest Forum  from 2012 to 2016,"This report highlights some findings from evaluation activities that have been undertaken on projects implemented by the African Forest Forum (AFF). Specifically, the evaluations were undertaken with four objectives that demonstrate the contribution of AFF (a) to improved access to up to date information on forestry, (b) to enhanced knowledge and skills among forestry experts to advance sustainable forest management (SFM) in Africa, (c) to changes to institutional plans, policies and structures that are favorable to SFM, and (d) to increased collaboration, networking and partnerships among stakeholders in forestry to promote SFM.

Information from AFF that could be attributed to the first objective, viz. to contribute to improved access to forestry information by stakeholders, was communicated to target audiences through all AFF channels of communication including the website, info mail, meetings and workshops organized by the projects. Most of the respondents (78%) to the surveys reported accessing most information from AFF through the info mail, followed by the website (63%) and AFF publications (53%). The social media pages were the least frequently accessed because they are relatively new communication channels for AFF and members are most probably not very familiar with them; while the info mail was popular because information was conveyed through email, that most people access on a regular basis. About 85% of respondents expressed satisfaction with performance of various aspects of the AFF website, specifically its accessibility, content, coverage, navigation, and interactivity.

Eastern Africa had more respondents accessing AFF information at 33%, compared to West Africa (29%), Central Africa (11%), Southern Africa (17%) and 8% from countries outside Africa.

Academic institutions (comprising universities, university colleges and technical colleges) comprised 45% of respondents who visited the AFF website, followed by research organizations and government institutions at 28% and 17% respectively. Academic institutions and research organizations accessed all the publications more than any other institution, whereas government institutions accessed journal articles, fact sheets, policy briefs and news articles more than civil society organizations, including NGOs. However, the latter access books more than government institutions and both equally accessed technical reports.

In the end, information sourced from AFF has led to improvement in institutional plans, structures, operations and standards for some institutions. Such changes included:
 incorporation of aspects from these two trainings in teaching material to guide professional training at universities,
 facilitating formulating institutional strategic plans and business plans,
 facilitating development national forest certification standards and regulations
 development of partnerships and collaborative activities
 guidance to development of:
o good forest management/governance practices like code of ethics (in some cases a professional foresters bill was developed for parliament action into law),
o electronic portal between countries to track cross border trade in forest products, and
o good co-management contracts/agreements between local communities and the central government in managing forest resources

Collaborations and partnerships were also formed through the networking facilitated by AFF during the workshops and training sessions.  The partnerships included:
 Partnerships for joint fundraising on common issues in sustainable forest management
 Partnerships with government institutions for development and implementation of policies and regulations
 Research partnerships between peer institutions and individuals to promote sustainable forest management
 Public-private-partnerships on mutually aggregable forestry issues

Overall, there is a growing acceptance, by target beneficiaries, of AFFs knowledge products and other resources. This could potentially lead to the use of such products by the target audiences, including institutions, to improve their policies and operations. This then could facilitate the sustained management and use of forest and tree resources on the continent in ways that enhance local community livelihoods, national incomes and stability of the environment as envisaged in the mission of AFF.",African Forest Forum (AFF),2017,Report,20377,8/23/2022 6:19,https://afforum.org/oldaff/sites/default/files/English/English_145.pdf,
12522,AFF Website Analysis Report,"The African Forest Forum (AFF) website serves as a knowledge and information hub on African forestry for its members and stakeholders. It avails knowledge on priority issues that are critical for the development of the forest sector including current, new and emerging issues, to inform policy making, investment decisions and capacity building at continental, regional and national levels.

AFFs website also provides daily information drawn from the news, social media, international and business community that form the agenda of on-going discussions, making it both transparent and accessible to all stakeholders. It gives greater access to data and emerging knowledge through collaboration with more members and organizations, while enhancing data literacy around the world.

In the year 2016, a detailed analysis of the websites performance from January  November, has been undertaken to evaluate its progress in meeting objectives of the AFF communications strategy. The aim was to decipher a clear understanding of the websites progress in meeting objectives of the AFF communications strategy. Findings for each of the key metrics are presented in this report through the most widely used web analytics service on the Internet  Google Analytics. For each of the key variables, specific ways to improve performance have been recommended in order to increase effectiveness of the website.",African Forest Forum (AFF),2016,Report,20373,3/10/2017 11:06,https://afforum.org/oldaff/sites/default/files/English/English_163.pdf,
12523,Assessment of National Forest Programme Processes and Plans in Southern Africa,"Southern African forest ecosystems (both natural and exotic) provide a wide range of economic, social and ecological services and are under threat from various causes, hence the need to implement sustainable forest management (SFM) practices. SFM calls for the use of the National Forest Programme (nfp) process to develop, implement and monitor nfps. The latter are a mutually agreed portfolio of forest sector initiatives, and the nfp approach focuses on the involvement of key stakeholders in the process. Several Southern African countries are participating in the nfp process through the NFP Facility housed by FAO. However, progress made in implementing nfp driven plans varies with country. The objective of this study was therefore to understand constraints and opportunities in implementing nfp processes and plans; to facilitate the sharing of lessons among countries; and to produce policy briefs that advocate for improved nfp implementation. This paper focuses on Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe and is based on literature reviews; visits undertaken to the three countries; and feedback from a regional workshop attended by key stakeholders from southern and eastern African countries. Conclusions and recommendations are made in the areas of national forest programmes; forestry sector legislative and institutional reforms; profile of the forestry sector; and forestry resource use.
The nfp process emphasizes inclusivity which has been achieved through support from the NFP Facility to study countries. The process has however been constrained by the absence of full time coordinating units within forestry departments; and lack of jurisdiction of the coordinating units and their multi-stakeholder committees over emerging global issues such as green economies and monitoring of nfp implementation. The following is therefore recommended: establishment of well-resourced and institutionalized nfp coordinating units within forestry departments; alignment of nfps with other national and regional planning processes; and design and implementation of a robust M&E tool that addresses both process and conservation impact delivery.

12524,Private forestry sector in Cameroon: status and potential,"Cameroon's land area covers about 46 million ha with 16.8 million ha as dense tropical forests and 29.8 million ha as degraded humid forests. The almost double proportion of degraded forests to dense forests is a good indication of human induced disturbance of the forest ecosystem in Cameroon. History has its role to play in the current state of Cameroonian forests but the contemporary influences are governed by the legal and regulatory texts in place. Today, total surface area of Cameroon's forests is 23 035 630 ha representing 48.73% of the national territory. The forests are classified as production and protection forests or remain unclassified. Production forests are exploited and managed under four forest management regimes, and in keeping with several management conventions, standards or multi-lateral environmental agreements (MEAs) such as the UN Forest Principles/Agenda 21 and also with several partnerships.
This study seeks to identify, promote promising public private partnership (PPP) models or approaches for forest compatible sustainable livelihoods development and strengthen the capacity of the industry to address both social and environmental concerns in ways that can contribute to more sustainable, equitable and effective private sector development.",African Forest Forum (AFF),2016,Report,20380,11/9/2017 12:46,https://afforum.org/oldaff/sites/default/files/English/English_164.pdf,
12525,Private forestry sector in Tanzania: status and potential,"In many African countries, the private sector in forestry is almost non-existent as an organized entity that one can dialogue with. This is also true in Tanzania, the country this study reports on, and where the sector is at its infancy, and needs to be nurtured to become stronger and better organized for it to significantly contribute to the national economy. In this regard, it has to be organized and coordinated as an entity and the many diverse actors who largely operate informally have to be strengthened. This study was conducted with this in mind; that is to facilitate the development of an organized private sector in forestry in Tanzania.",African Forest Forum (AFF),2016,Report,20378,7/9/2017 16:47,https://afforum.org/oldaff/sites/default/files/English/English_160.pdf,
12526,Private forestry sector in Kenya: status and potential,"This study provides information to support catalysing the emergence of organized private sector in forestry in Kenya, through promotion of promising public private partnership (PPP) approaches for sustainable forest management and enhanced livelihoods including gender considerations.
The projection on supply and demand of products in the country indicates that the demand for various forest products is fast growing as compared to supply potential from the various sector actors. MENR (2013) study found that Kenya has a wood supply potential of 31.4 million m3 against a national demand of 41.7 million m3 hence a current deficit of 10.3 million m3. Timber, poles, fire wood and charcoal supply stands at 7,363,414m3, 3,028,907m3, 13,654,022m3 and 7,358,717m3 while demand stands at 5,262,624m3, 1,409,482m3, 18,702,748m3 and 16,325,810m3 respectively. MENR (2013) forecast for a 20 year period 2010-2032 indicates that the total forest product supplies will increase by 20% and overall demand by 21.6% which signifies a gradually increasing deficit.
Therefore entry of private sector with desired financial capital and operational efficiency expertise will compliment public and smallholder actors in expansion of the sector forest product supply capacity and contribution to overall national economic development",African Forest Forum (AFF),2016,Report,20371,8/22/2022 13:23,https://afforum.org/oldaff/sites/default/files/English/English_159.pdf,
12527,Newsletter Vol 7 Issue 1 EN,"Message from the Executive Secretary
I am pleased to share with you our AFF e-newsletter. Since our last newsletter, there have been several new and exciting stories to share with the African forestry community.
The adoption of the first-ever UN Strategic Plan for Forests 2017-2030 (UNSPF) and related four-year work programme by the UN General Assembly on 27 April 2017 was a historic move to provide a global framework for action at all levels to sustainably manage all types of forests and trees outside forests and contain deforestation and degradation. The signing of the Paris Climate Agreement by 195 countries raised the profile of forests in ways unparalleled. The 2030 Agenda, complemented by the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, contains a goal and various targets on forests to guide investments and a review process that will allow all partners to assess the impact of their actions.
All these agendas have established a good framework for international cooperation and action on forests at all levels that is crucial for enhancing sustainable forest management (SFM) practices. While collaborative partnerships are the way forward for lasting progress on SFM, information exchange on the strengths of and lessons learned by countries on the continent can accelerate replication of results and practices to benefit more people and also secure the protection of our environment.
AFF has accumulated a reasonable body of knowledge and experience in forestry and related issues. In the last few months AFF has facilitated knowledge exchange and collaboration among countries on various aspects related to forests and trees on the continent. At the regional level, we have partnered with various institutions and forestry experts to share findings from studies on priority issues affecting the forestry sector. These are related to climate change in forestry, forestry in green economy, provision of quality tree germplasm on the continent, state of forest pests and diseases in Africa, state of forest certification in Africa, and public private partnerships in the sector. For the most part, these exchanges have been peer-to-peer, practical and cost-effective.
Beyond the African region, AFF has collaborated with other stakeholders, and more specifically in providing back up to African delegates in the process that culminated in development and adoption of the  UN Strategic Plan for Forests 2017-2030 (UNSPF) and related four-year work programme.  It is very gratifying that Africa participated very actively in this process and owns the outputs of the process.  AFF continues to strengthen the capacity of individuals and institutions and is currently  supporting 22 postgraduate students who are  undertaking their research work within the framework of the work implemented by the institution, in addition to another four students on a masters degree programme implemented jointly between AFF and Bern University of Applied Sciences in Switzerland.
AFF successfully organized the Second Meeting of the Members Forum that was held electronically from 27 February-3 March 2017. I wish to congratulate the newly elected Chair, Prof. Demel Teketay and Vice Chair, Mr. Ibro Adamou of the Members Forum to office for the next five years. I also take this opportunity to thank Prof. Fredrick Owino and Dr. Abdelazim Mirghan Ibrahim, now our Past Chair and Vice Chair respectively. We are indebted to them for their contributions to the growth of the Members Forum.
I hope you enjoy reading this newsletter.

12529,Situational analysis of tree breeding and tree germplasm supply in Africa: underpinning sustainable forest management.  Working Paper Vol. 3(1),"Forests and planted trees provide sustenance to many millions of people in Africa, particularly the vulnerable, women and children. Balancing utilisation of forest resources and growth of forests and trees forms the basis of sustainable forest management (SFM). Africas natural and planted forests are not sustainably supplying wood and other products to meet the needs of the growing population as well as the demand of national, regional and international markets. Serious shortages of wood are forecast in many countries for the near future and this has negative socio-economic implications. The African Forest Forum (AFF) recognised the need to improve SFM in Africa through planting trees using genetically improved planting stock for establishment of industrial plantations, community tree woodlots and agro-forests. This report is based on situational analyses of tree breeding and tree germplasm supply conducted in West and Central Africa (Avana-Tientcheu, 2016), Eastern Africa (Msanga, 2016) and Southern Africa (Marunda, 2016).
To understand trends in the choice of species and estimate seed demand, the studies looked at forest statistics in selected African countries and reviewed the history of tree planting (introduction of species and provenances), afforestation, reforestation statistics and conservation needs. Plantation development has been generally successful in countries where the private sector has been encouraged and supported to invest in tree planting (e.g. South Africa, Tanzania and Congo), research (Congo, Ghana, South Africa, Tanzania and Zimbabwe) and tree germplasm development (Burkina Faso). Community tree planting for agroforestry, whilst still in the nascent stages of development, has been encouraged and supported by international donors. Distribution of seed is mainly through informal farmer networks supported by local and international organisations, national tree seed centres (e.g. Burkina Faso) and the private sector (e.g. in South Africa). The users of tree germplasm in African countries have become diverse - from large plantation corporations, community-based organisations and city councils, to small-scale tree growers, including farmers groups and individual farmers including women keen to plant indigenous fruit trees to improve their livelihoods. This diversity brings with it challenges and opportunities. Challenges may include how to supply a variety of high quality tree seed from a range of species whilst the diversity offers opportunities for the rural communities to be involved in the supply chain of tree germplasm.
The studies showed that Africa, like most parts of the world, has imported, tested, shared, exchanged, sold and improved genetic resources for tree species. Use of genetically improved planting stock was reported in all countries in Africa although the levels of use vary from country to country, with countries such as South Africa having the most sophisticated tree germplasm development and deployment systems. Some countries, e.g. South Africa and Zimbabwe, acknowledged the presence of species and provenance trials which revealed the best performing species and provenances, seed sources and provided the material for tree improvement and for subsequent deployment to operational plantings. Other countries, especially in West and Central Africa (except Ghana), reported that most provenance trials were abandoned and illegally exploited and most data and information has been lost.
A new wave of establishment of commercial plantations is sweeping through many parts of Africa, for example in Congo (Eucalyptus Fibres du Congo), Ghana (Africa Plantations for Sustainable Development, Siricec, Miro Forestry), Mozambique (New Forests Green Resources, Florestas Do Planalto, Chikweti Forests, Florestas de Niassa), Rwanda (New Forests), South Africa (International Finance Corporation, Hans Merensky), South Sudan (Maris Capita), Tanzania (Green Resources, New Forests, Kilombero Valley Teak Company), Zambia (Green Forest Development) and Uganda (Sawlog Production Grant Scheme). This new wave of plantation development has seen an increase in the demand of tree germplasm and new species for planting in marginal areas that are available for afforestation.
In 2016, the Forests for the Future  New Forests for Africa initiative was launched in Ghana with the aim to stimulate and drive large scale reforestation in Africa. The set target is to plant 100 million hectares of new forests. The Great Green Wall Initiative was launched in 2011 and involves 12 countries of which 8 are from West Africa. The goal is to plant trees as a means to try to stop, or even to reverse, the desertification process, which is the main ecological problem of many countries with arid climates (e.g., Niger, Chad, Mali, Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Mauritania and Senegal). The need and call to plant more trees (e.g., Billion Trees Campaign and Green Belt Movement) will increase the demand for seed and new species, and national tree seed centres will need to be prepared for the increased seed demand and identify priority tree species.
The reviews of tree breeding and tree germplasm supply and demand in Africa showed a decreasing trend in research and development investments and widening gaps in the supply of good quality germplasm. Given the forecasted increase in tree planting and the recorded threats of pest and diseases to forest genetic resources in Africa (Bosu, 2016; Gichora, 2016; Kojwang, 2016;), tree planting programmes in Africa might not reach the optimum productivity levels if germplasm supply and pest and disease threats are not addressed. Forestry development in Africa will have to address these issues as part of a wider programme to achieve SFM.
It is clear that most African countries recognise that SFM is achieved by combining strategies that conserve and encourage regeneration of native tree (e.g. Ngitili in Tanzania; Zai in Burkina Faso; landscape restoration in Maradi and Zinder (Niger), coppice management in the miombo woodlands of Southern Africa) and the promotion of tree planting at large plantation scales and at the farmer level. The choice of species for commercial plantations has been decided based on decades of research on species trials and collaborative research for agroforestry species. For newer species for agroforestry, research is still fairly new and a number of candidate species are still being tested and promoted.
The commonly planted species in Africa are Eucalyptus, Pinus, Acacia, Hevea species Tectona grandis and Gmelina arborea for the primary supply of industrial wood, rubber, gums and fuelwood. The first two genera have formed the backbone for commercial tree planting and have undergone several cycles of selections and in some cases mating to create new clones or varieties. The genera are attractive because of the shorter economic and reproductive rotations that are possible. Recently, agroforestry species for intercropping, alley cropping, fodder provision and indigenous fruit trees have been tested for growth and productivity in many African countries. Indigenous tropical hardwoods such as Khaya senegalensis, Khaya anthotheca and Milicia excelsa have been domesticated as plantation species in tropical countries. Acacia senegal and Acacia seyal have been planted in plantations for gum Arabic production (hashab and talha from the two species respectively). Faidherbia albida is commonly planted throughout the continent for soil amelioration, provision of fodder for livestock and firewood.
A number of indigenous commercial hardwoods are harvested from natural forests in all the regions but more so in West Africa. Priced hardwoods such as Milicia excelsa, Entandrophragma spp., Triplochiton scleroxylon, Terminalia spp., Nauclea diderrichii, Khaya spp., Pericopsis elata and many others are harvested by concessionaires. Although most of the countries developed sound forest policies oriented toward sustainable forest management, there are low levels of incentives to conserve or apply sound silvicultural practices to ensure regeneration of most species. Germplasm of good phenotypes is therefore lost during harvesting, as seed is not collected for replanting. Physiological characteristics of seeds for most tropical hardwood species are either recalcitrant or unknown (i.e., do not store for long periods under low temperature and moisture conditions), thus making it difficult to store the seed for future use.
The review of tree germplasm production in Africa showed that Africas forest sectors, both commercial and community forestry, need quality seeds, but the continents capacity to supply good tree planting stock varies from good to poor depending on the country. Countries often lack the institutional capacity to support the growth of tree seed markets (an issue that cuts across boundaries), tree breeding research, seed production, seed storage and testing, and regulation. Expertise in tree breeding, tree germplasm management and investment could help build the capacity to produce good quality tree seeds and improve on other aspects of the tree seed sector, including management, logistics, deployment and the integration of new species and technologies.
Since many tree species used in plantations or agroforestry were found to be the same across the continent, indicating a wider ecological and economic range than individual countries, it is prudent to have regional research programmes on tree breeding and improvement, germplasm management, and share information on silvicultural aspects, environmental benefits, impacts on soils and biodiversity, pest/disease prevention, wood utilisation and economics.","Marunda, C.

12532,Forestry and Resilience to Climate Change: A Synthesis on Application of Forest-Based Adaptation Strategies to Reduce Vulnerability Among Communities in Sub-Saharan Africa,"Forests and trees outside forests play an important role on mitigation of climate change through sequestering of carbon from the atmosphere. However, little has been documented on the role of forestry in adaptation to climate change. The objective of this paper was therefore to identify and analyse forest-based adaptation strategies employed in sub-Saharan Africa that have the potential of enhancing resilience of vulnerable communities to the impacts of climate change, with a view of recommending them for up-scale and adoption. The study employed both desk review approach and primary data collection through focused group discussion from 12 African countries. A review of selected studies commissioned by African forest Forum in sub-Saharan Africa was undertaken and synthesis carried out to delineate role of forestry in improving resilience to climate change to various forest ecosystems and people. It also builds from review of related reports and other publications on forestry as relates to climate change. The study revealed forest and tree-based systems in the context of sustainable forest management plays a significant role on disaster risk reduction and abatement to impacts of climate change. Specifically, tree planting and forest conservation aid protection of soil and land against detrimental impacts of flooding. Rehabilitation of degraded lands and forests through tree planting and good forest management practices enhances water quality and other vital environmental services. Such benefits associated with forests and tree-based systems improve capacity of communities in upstream and downstream to ameliorate impacts of climate change. Overall, the adaptation strategies such as: sustainable forest management (SFM); agroforestry systems; forestry and food production; commercial forestry; and other ecosystem based interventions enhance resilience among the vulnerable communities in the sub-Saharan Africa. The development of appropriate institutions, policy and legal frameworks that support national initiatives such as National Adaptation Programmes of Actions (NAPAs), forest based Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC) as well as NDCs and other coping mechanisms that integrate both adaptation and mitigation remains vital in strengthening resilience of vulnerable social groups and biophysical systems to the impacts of climate change.

Southern Forests: a Journal of Forest Science, Vol. 79","Forests in Africa support the livelihoods of millions of people through provision of timber and non-timber&nbsp;forest products, food and nutrition, energy and payment of environmental services. However, mismanagement&nbsp;of forests has resulted in deforestation and forest degradation, thereby contributing to the increased emission&nbsp;of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This special issue highlights some of the research outcomes presented&nbsp;at a pre-congress workshop organised by the African Forest Forum and partners at the 2015 World Forestry&nbsp;Congress. In this issue, the main drivers of land degradation are highlighted vis-à-vis population growth,&nbsp;agricultural expansion, climate variability, drought and energy needs. Promising traditional management&nbsp;practices are identified including age-old farmer-managed natural regeneration and exclosures. In addition,&nbsp;research presented indicates that age-old systems such as native non-browse shrubs in Ethiopia are important&nbsp;in that they facilitate regeneration of late-successional tree species. Furthermore, opportunities for using forests&nbsp;to mitigate climate change are highlighted with a case study on the economics associated with carbon markets.&nbsp;The issue also highlights the methodological challenges of quantifying carbon in African forests. The effect of&nbsp;climate change on threatened forest species and biodiversity in general is discussed, and the associated human
disturbances impacting on the population structure of a threatened species, e.g. Afzelia africana in West Africa, is&nbsp;presented. The important role of non-timber forest products in income generation for the rural communities and&nbsp;the associated challenges of commercialisation is emphasised with examples from two important tree species:&nbsp;shea (Vitellaria paradoxa) and baobab (Adansonia digitata). Finally, the issue covers a people-centred approach&nbsp;in tree planting and management where studies demonstrated that there are still problems of poor participation&nbsp;of local communities due to poor implementation of enabling policies, lack of involvement in initial planning and
subsequent lack of clear benefit-sharing mechanisms.","Chirwa, P. W., Larwanou, M. & Kowero, G.",2015,Journal Article,,,http://afforum.org/sites/default/files/English/English_154.pdf,
12534,Forest certification: a soft policy instrument to promote sustainable forest management in Africa.  Policy Brief. Vol. 4 (1),"Context
Forest resources and trees outside forests provide multiple benefits and have direct and measurable impacts on peoples lives. Forests, trees on farms, and agroforestry systems play important roles in the livelihoods of rural people by providing employment, energy, nutritious foods and a wide range of goods and ecosystem services in most regions of the world (FAO, 2014). Over 90% of the 1.2 billion people living in extreme poverty depend on forests for some part of their livelihoods.  They have also fulfilled and continue to fulfil critical economic, environmental, social and cultural functions (FAO, 2003; Barklund and Teketay, 2004).In addition, well managed forests have tremendous potential to contribute to sustainable development and a greener economy.
Despite their critical importance, forest resources have been faced with different problems, which continue to prevent them from realizing their full potential contribution to economic and social development as well as environmental conservation. Deforestation has continued unabated in Africa as a result of destruction, clearing or incineration of forest and woodland resources for the expansion of crop cultivation spurred by an ever-increasing human population. Further, fuelwood harvesting, human settlement, mining, road construction, among others, also contribute to deforestation. Illegal logging and unsustainable forest resources utilization caused by improper and unplanned harvesting practices have resulted in wastage of wood, owing to very low recovery rates and damage to the residual trees/plants and stands.
The consequences of these and other  problems include the reduction of the forest and tree cover, leading to serious wood deficits in some countries (which in turn leads to further mining of the remaining forest resources). Further, the reduction of forest quality through environmental degradation  results into the decline/loss of biodiversity, the degradation/loss of water resources, the loss of cultural assets and knowledge, the loss of livelihoods of forest-dependent peoples, and not least enhanced global warming/climate change (Teketay, 2004-2005; Kowero et al., 2009; Chidumayo et al., 2011). Hence, stakeholders at various levels of the value chain of the forest sector are confronted with a range of challenging questions related to the current and future state of forest resources and their ability to contribute to sustainable development.","Teketay, D.",2016,Policy Brief,20383,8/23/2022 7:27,https://afforum.org/oldaff/sites/default/files/English/English_132.pdf,https://afforum.org/oldaff/sites/default/files/French/French_81.pdf
12535,"Forest law enforcement, good forest governance and fair trade in forest products in Africa","Introduction
In 2003 African ministers signed a Ministerial Declaration on African Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (AFLEG) that galvanized their commitment to strengthening the forestry sector through good forest governance, enforcement of forest laws and regulations and promotion of fair trade in forest and wildlife resources. AFLEG is very clear on its commitment to eradicate illegalities in the forestry sector. Later some countries in Africa have also adopted the European FLEGT-VPAs (Voluntary Agreements) in guiding trade between European countries and themselves, among other things.  A study conducted by AFF on implementation or adherence to these two FLEGT processes in Africa","Kakuru, W.",2016,Factsheet,20379,8/23/2022 6:55,https://afforum.org/oldaff/sites/default/files/English/English_155.pdf,

Southern Forests: a Journal of Forest Science, Vol. 79, 2017.  10.2989/20702620.2016.1255419","The highest deforestation and forest degradation rates in Africa occur in the dry forests and woodlands where pressure for land is increasing, poverty is rampant, livelihood options are few and climate change effects are severe. This paper examines factors that cause land and forest degradation in the Sahel and dry forests and woodlands of eastern and southern Africa and highlights some successful restoration practices, technologies and approaches. In the Sahel, enclosures are used to protect young growing trees while in East Africa enclosures are implemented
on degraded land as a mechanism for environmental rehabilitation with a clear biophysical impact. The choice of techniques for rehabilitating specific degraded areas depends first on the priorities and management objectives of stakeholders followed by the costs and benefits associated with available rehabilitation techniques and the economic, social, and environmental values of the land resources in their current and desired future states. In the Sahel, sustainable land management is considered to be an imperative for their sustainable development and the practices include soil and water conservation activities and structures. In all regions, natural forest rehabilitation has used both natural and assisted regeneration to promote the growth of especially indigenous species through coppice regrowth and root suckers rather than seeds. Assisted regeneration was especially prevalent in the Sahel where indigenous tree species have been identified to dominate the degraded sites during early stages of secondary forest succession. The success of any rehabilitation activities depends on community-based natural resources management. In addition, the forest policies and their related policies need to be enabling in order to address issues of concern, including (1) the full participation of communities, (2) clear land and tree tenure and (3) equitable benefit sharing.","Chirwa, P.

Multiple generalised linear models and non-linear diameterheight equations were fitted to contrast the individual effects of categorical variables, such as climatic zone and disturbance level. Results revealed significantly higher scaling coefficients in less drier regions and low-disturbance stands. The diameterheight relationship was more controlled by the climatic zone than by the disturbance level. Accordingly, the disturbance level contributed only to the intercept of the diameterheight model, whereas the climatic zone significantly influenced both intercept and slope. In addition, when climatic zone and disturbance level were considered as sources of variation in the diameterheight model, the former explained the greater marginal variance. It was concluded that climate has the greater effect on population structure of A. africana in natural stands.","Assogbadjo, A. E., Mensah, S. & Kakaï, R.

12542,Strengthening African capacity to monitor and report on compliance to international processes related to forests and climate change. Working Paper Vol.  3(2),"The African continent remains the most vulnerable region in the world to the impact of climate change, mainly due to weak resilience and adaptive capacity. There is limited knowledge on the relationship between forests and climate change in Africa; and especially on adaptation and mitigation to the adverse effects of climate change, as well as capitalizing on the opportunities that climate change and variability offer the continent.  Understanding, strengthening and further developing the relationship between forest and climate is therefore key issue to Africas future development. This is because of the key roles forests and trees outside forests play in the lives of people and animals on the continent, as well as on the economies of African countries and the environment in which the people, livestock and wildlife live in.  However, the nature of this relationship and its impact is greatly influenced by how international forest and climate change and related agreements are incorporated into national policies and practices.
With respect to the Africa, it is important to understand how individual African countries are  implementing ideas and recommendations that come from international conventions, agreements, protocols, and other initiatives (all of them are in this text referred to as international agreements) that have a bearing on how climate change and variation could affect forests and vice versa. This could facilitate positioning the forest sector better to contain the adverse effects of climate change as well as take advantage of opportunities that come with the same. It would also make it easier to profile Africa and its sub-regions both at regional and international levels. This could lead to enhanced collaboration and support from institutions and other players that support the implementation of these international agreements, and especially during this era when forests are increasingly seen as contributing not only to international public goods but to international services like carbon sequestration that has global implications.
The study whose results are reported in this document was commissioned by the African Forest Forum with the  several objectives, namely: to assess how individual African countries are implementing the forest, climate change and related international conventions; how these international conventions are adding value to their national forestry sector policies and programmes; and to develop an approach on how Africa can to monitor and report on compliance to international processes related to forests and climate. The study was conducted in eight African countries, namely: Cameroon, Rwanda, Gabon, Nigeria, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Niger and Tanzania.","Gondo, P.

12543,Training module on effective engagement of African delegates in international multilateral processes.,"A recent assessment by the African Forest Forum on the participation of African negotiators in international multilateral processes on forests and related issues revealed that a great majority of the African forest experts have not participated in any international negotiations, have never experienced agenda item writing and discussion, nor had experience in searching for funds for travel and participation in negotiations. However, a majority expressed the desire to have experiences in negotiations, especially in the acquisition of negotiation skills and to overcome the kind of challenges that are seen as hindering the right acquisition of skills in negotiations and the paucity of successful negotiators from Africa.
Based on these indications a draft training manual has been designed. It is presented in 3 parts. The first part summarises the theory of negotiation considering the essential elements of negotiations, the kinds of skills needed in negotiations, how to build these skills, basic steps and characteristic attributes of a good negotiator. The second part considers in-depth processes involved in negotiations in multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) and other agreements which also look at the basics of MEA negotiations including issues such as governance, national and group negotiation positions, the plenaries, working groups and High Level Segment. The final part considers the Collaborative Partnership on Forests (CPF) membership and their roles and contributions to promote forest issues, among others.
It is established from these analyses that for successful negotiations, various roles are required to be performed by countries and their representatives. Country Parties and members together with their member representatives have obligations to make adequate preparations, select participants carefully based on merit using their own criteria but usually basing the selection of participants on their ability and readiness to negotiate. Parties and members are required to guarantee funding through appropriate budgetary allocations. The participants have obligation to properly and fully represent these Parties, institutions and organizations. The negotiations and the negotiators are governed by a code of conduct which is enshrined in the agreed rules of procedure that are usually part of the negotiation documents. The expectations are that all participants will negotiate in an atmosphere of peace, understanding and cordiality with the ultimate aim of generating win-win outcomes that are based on compromises and mutual respect which promote the prevalence of consensus building.","Oteng-Yeboah, A.

However, access to finance for small-scale forest enterprises such as shea butter production and marketing remains a fundamental problem, which affects the growth and performance of these enterprises. This study, therefore, assessed the financing schemes and delivery mechanisms available for the production and marketing of the product in Tamale, Northern Region of Ghana. It also identified the financial structures available to shea butter producers, including constraints of the financial delivery mechanisms. Using a social survey, the study purposively selected and interviewed 83 women who engaged in shea butter processing. Of these, 86% were full-time processors of shea butter and 14% were involved in other businesses, such as petty trading, groundnut and rice processing. The study revealed low patronage of financial services as only 18% of the respondents took loans. A high proportion (82%) of the respondents were under contract financing with companies that purchased the shea butter. This financing arrangement made it difficult for the women to expand their activities as they usually were unable to negotiate and receive competitive prices for their shea butter. Non-governmental organisations and some financial organisations were involved in providing technical support services to the producers. However, there was an absence of continuous support services in credit management. The high illiteracy rate (97%) of shea butter producers made it challenging for the women to access formal training programmes to make them aware of opportunities that exist for financing their business. There is the need for targeted collaboration among stakeholders to improve existing financing schemes. In the long term, there should be policies to standardise the activities of the shea butter industry to improve access to credit, which could lead to the sustainable growth of these enterprises.","Kombiok, E. & Agbenyega, O.",2017,Journal Article,20367,8/22/2022 12:36,https://afforum.org/oldaff/sites/default/files/English/English_148.pdf,

The NTFPs investigated were bush mango (Irvingia gabonensis), African walnut (Plukenetia conophora), chew-stick (Massularia acuminata), fever bark (Annickia chlorantha) and bush pepper (Piper guineense). Field data were collected in 10 villages located within and around Omo and Shasha forest reserves using a household questionnaire survey. The results showed that seasonality, poor transport, lack of storage facilities and market information were the four main constraints influencing marketing and trade in the NTFPs. In addition, the level of education, gender (sex), household income, ethnicity, distance to the market and access to roads significantly influenced market knowledge and information among households involved in the trade of NTFPs. There is need to improve on the limited source of NTFPs information, enhance skills for product transformation, build innovative storage facilities, and develop the process of domestication and integration in traditional land-use systems.","Amusa, T.

12551,"Estimation Of Aboveground And Belowground Carbon Sequestration Of Cupressus Lusitanica, Pinus Patula And Eucalyptus Saligna Plantation Species In Kenya","Carbon sequestration has become a crucial service forests provide for regulation and mitigation of climate change through reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. In Kenya, Cupressus lusitanica, Pinus patula and Eucalyptus saligna are common exotic plantation species grown in high potential areas. They are characteristerised by fast growth resulting to removal of more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. However, little has been done in estimating aboveground and belowground carbon of these species. Therefore, this study sought to: estimate carbon sequestered by these species across ages and sites; and determine relationship between tree growth parameters and carbon biomass. The study was carried at Kiambu and Nyeri Counties in Central Kenya. A total of 99 plots measuring 20 by 50 m were established in government managed forest plantations of selected species stratified according to age and species in different forest compartments. Diameters at breast height, total height, crown diameter and crown depth were measured. CO2FIX V3.1 modelling framework was used in estimating carbon sequestered and linear mixed model used in the analysis of the data. There were significant differences (p=0.006) in the amount of carbon sequestered among species across sites.

12554,Newsletter Vol 5 Issue 4 EN & FR,"MESSAGE FROM THE EXECUTIVE SECRETARY
It is with great pleasure that the African Forest Forum brings you this special edition of our October 2015 newsletter. This newsletter has a strong focus on the XIV World Forestry Congress, held for the first time on the African continent, from 7-11 September 2015 in Durban, South Africa. It also gives some highlights from a Pre-XIV World Forestry Congress workshop on the theme Forests, people and environment: Some perspectives from Africa that was organized by AFF, in collaboration with African Union Commission, the Network for Natural Gums and Resins in Africa, the Centre for Sustainable Development- University of Ibadan and the Forest Research Network of Sub-Saharan Africa.
The Congress, whose theme was Forests and People: Investing in a Sustainable Future, was attended by nearly 4000 delegates from 142 countries, offered a good platform to discuss better ways for managing and protecting the worlds forests for the sake of humanity and the environment we all live in. With an ambitious agenda to among other things, explore the niche of forests and forestry in the 2030 Agenda on sustainable development, delegates at the Congress offered a vision for forests and forestry as a way of contributing to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for a sustainable future to 2050 and beyond.
The Congress outcome, the Durban Declaration, offers a set of four key recommendations that see forests playing a decisive role in food and livelihood security as well as the fight against climate change. It calls for ways for improving policies and practices that promote integrated approaches to land use and addressing the causes of deforestation. The declaration also highlights the need for further investment in forest education, communication, research and the creation of jobs - especially for the youth. New partnerships among the forest, agriculture, finance, energy, water and other sectors, as well as strong engagement with indigenous peoples  and local communities are equally stressed in the declaration.
As we look ahead to the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) in Paris, we are encouraged by the outcome of the Congress as well as the maturity of the dialogue. It is clear from the collective ideas and experience of the global forestry community that the next six years will hold promising pathways towards unlocking the true potential of forests in sustainable development. Our challenge is to now ensure that these strategies are turned into concrete actions.
This newsletter highlights some of the key messages and insights from participants to the Pre-XIV World Forestry Congress workshop, organized by AFF and partners, in support of the Durban Declaration and of whom were honored to share, network and participate in this unique experience. We wish to thank the Government and people of South Africa for hosting and various forms of support to the pre- XIV WFC workshop in Durban. In the same vein, we wish to thank the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) and the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida). We also gratefully acknowledge the generous assistance accorded unto us by the Conference Secretariat in making our pre-event a success.

12555,Development of wood-based industries in Sub-Saharan Africa.,"This study was undertaken as part of the initiative by the Royal Swedish Academy of Agriculture and Forestry (KSLA) in collaboration with the Forestry Department of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), and the African Forest Research Network (AFORNET) at the African Academy of Sciences (AAS) on Lessons Learnt on Sustainable Forest Management in Africa. The initiative aims to:

analyse and establish what lessons have been learnt from positive and negative experiences of various initiatives, projects and programmes focusing on the sustainable management, use and conservation of forests in sub-Saharan Africa; 
analyse and establish the ecological, economic, social and other pre-requisites for extending the positive lessons for wider application (i.e. to more people, larger areas, other countries, etc.); and 
based on the outcome of the above analyses, to identify the most urgent issues and concerns for Africa, and draw them to the attention of the various international processes.","Asumadu, K.",2004,Report,,22/10/2015 11:58,http://afforum.org/sites/default/files/English/English_126.pdf,
12556,"The Vi AgroForestry Programme in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda.","In late 2002, the African Academy of Sciences (AAS), the Royal Swedish Academy of Agriculture and Forestry (KSLA) and the Forestry Department of FAO jointly initiated a project entitled Lessons learnt on Sustainable Forest management in Africa.  In February 2004, a workshop was held in Nairobi presenting and discussing nine papers on various aspects of forest management, use and conservation in Africa and experiences on these from which lessons could be learnt. The papers had been commissioned to expertise in different institutions and companies on the continent. During the workshop a few additional case studies were also presented. Among them, Mr. Åke Barklund, outgoing Director for Sidas Regional Land Management Unit (RELMA), suggested three case studies capturing some RELMA experiences over the last years:

Ethiopian land and tree tenure.
The Vi Agroforestry Programme in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda.
Forest Certification in Africa.","Barklund, A.",2004,Report,,22/10/2015 11:52,http://afforum.org/sites/default/files/English/English_125.pdf,
12557,Development of trade and marketing of nonwood forest products for poverty alleviation in Africa.,"This paper is one amongst several commissioned by the project Lessons Learnt on Sustainable Forest Management in Africa, or SFM in Africa, for short. The understanding that several forestry projects, programmes and initiatives have already been carried out in Africa, and that major lessons can be learnt from them, was the reason for setting up the project. It was believed that such lessons, whether they were positive or negative, if properly analysed could be of great importance in shaping the direction of future initiatives to achieve sustainable forest management (SFM). Replicating positive experiences and avoiding failures could lead to better utilisation of scarce financial and human resources. Moreover, this type of project has no precedent in Africa, in that most past project evaluations mainly dwelled on impact studies against stated objectives and did not go beyond this level. The studies commissioned by this project have undertaken in-depth assessments of notable successes and failures and have tried
to identify the factors that might have contributed to such outcomes. Based on the foregoing understanding, the project has the following overall objectives:

- To analyse and establish what lessons have been learnt from positive and negative experiences of various initiatives, projects and programmes aiming at sustainable management, use and conservation of forests in sub-Saharan Africa;
To analyse and establish what ecological, economic, social and other pre-requisites are necessary for extending positive lessons to wider use (to more people, larger areas, other countries, etc.); and 
Based on the outcome of the above analyses, to identify the most urgent issues and concerns for Africa to draw the attention of the various international processes.","Tieguhong, J. C. & Ndoye, O.",2004,Report,,22/10/2015 11:48,http://afforum.org/sites/default/files/English/English_127.pdf,

12559,Forest-livestock interactions in West Africa.,The Sahel is a climatic zone that stretches from the Atlantic Ocean to the Red Sea with a width of 400 km to 600 km from North to South and a rainfall ranging from 100 to 600 mm. This zone is characterised by sandy soils supporting thorny vegetation and a discontinuous layer of herbaceous species. Transhumance and nomadic grazing are the main forms of land uses although in some areas there are some rain fed and/or irrigated cropping systems.,"Nianogo, A. & Thomas, I.",2004,Report,,22/10/2015 10:34,http://afforum.org/sites/default/files/English/English_29.pdf,

12561,The state of Forest Education in Sub-Saharan Africa.,"As Africa enters the 21st century, many developmental challenges are encountered across the continent. Among them, the goal of achieving sustainable use of natural resources  especially forests - must remain in sharp focus and be addressed in a multi-prong approach. To better capture the role of forestry education and training on the continent, four key elements must be underpinned. First, the current status and future developments of the forestry profession must be placed in a historical context, traced back to early colonial influences, which, out of necessity, learnt and draw heavily on experiences from temperate region forestry. The consequence of a temperate region orientation of forestry training in Africa was a rather narrow-scope view of forestry adopted by colleges and universities. Arising from historical factors, the second aspect is that, with time, a largely public sector job market for which forestry education was targeted, shrunk and hence caused panic and a diminished regard of forestry as a profession among young potential foresters. The diminished job market in the forest sector has engendered an urgent need to re-engineer innovative means to make forestry attractive. This has called for many possible options: some forward-looking and others rather drastic. In some cases, forestry schools within countries or regions have used curriculum reforms to diversify or refocus their training programmes and, in other cases, funding to forestry education institutions has suffered major cut-backs which have seriously affected student enrolments. The dynamism between the apparent low public investment in forest education and declining numbers of students due to poor job markets creates a rather complex web making it difficult to pin-point the precise factors responsible for
and/or driving actual status and future direction of forestry education in Sub-Saharan Africa.
Thirdly, the past two decades saw a fundamental global paradigm shift in which empowerment of local populations in relation to management of natural resources  including forests  emerged as a dominant theme. Forests are seen in terms of broad multiple values and contributing directly to rural livelihood systems, and also seen as an integral component of land use and tenure regimes. It is this socio-economic mix of land resources that characterises the unique features of forestry in Sub-Saharan Africa. In addition, impacts of globalisation and trade liberalisation, the existence or lack of local and international markets for forest products, poverty and impacts of the devastating HIV/AIDS pandemic, all affect management of forests and other natural resources in the African landscape. Therefore, current forestry education and training must respond sufficiently to these emerging issues  not merely in a narrow sectoral manner, but rather through an integrated training approach of natural resources management disciplines. This calls for well fashioned and innovative approaches to forestry training curricula vis-à-vis that for other land use disciplines. We must seek to ensure that training approaches used lead to adoption of technologies in the larger agricultural sector that have beneficial impacts on Africas rural populations  it is imperative that tertiary training institutions produce agents of this change. Until recently, forestry training has remained largely traditional but there is now evidence of change taking place within institutions. This trend would need to be advanced and aggressively pursued so that forestry education on the continent is strategically placed in terms of producing adequately trained manpower for increasingly challenging tasks towards sustainable forest management. The primary goal is having a breed of foresters with skills and positive attitudes to transform livelihoods at the farmer level. We need to move beyond impacts derived only from those associated with logging and industrial forestry (thought this is not to say we abandon this function of forestry) to enhancing positive impacts at farm level. It also means ensuring that technology transfer to farmers is made affordable and practical, hence better and closer interaction between training, research and implementation.","Legilisho-Kiyiapi, J.",2004,Report,,22/10/2015 10:23,http://afforum.org/sites/default/files/English/English_56.pdf,
12562,Lessons Learnt on Community Forest Management in Africa.,"The search for sustainable methods of land use goes back to the 1950s when planned community development thrusts were introduced but later abandoned in the 1960s. In the late 1960s to early 1970s the concept of equity and participation re-emerged, to be buttressed a little later by the concept and approaches based on integrated rural development projects. This period was also dominated by campaigns to avert an impending fuelwood crisis in Africa. These projects promoted tree planting on-farm and reforestation of
degraded community forests on hilltops and areas of low agricultural potential.
In response to the outcry over the loss of tropical forests in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), many countries, with donor support, attempted in the 1970s and 1980s to bring more forests under state tenure and protection, and urged farmers to plant trees in their farms to relieve pressure from natural forests. Rural development initiatives focused on decentralisation, following recognition that centralised forest regimes, which exclude local knowledge and customary practices, were not achieving sustainable forest
management. During this time, the heightened concern about energy supplies, following the energy crisis in 1973, created an awareness of developing countries dependence on wood for cooking and other household needs. Increased investments were directed to development of improved charcoal and cooking stoves. Forest plantation programmes were intensified in many countries during this period, normally with donor support.","Odera, J.",2004,Report,,22/10/2015 09:07,http://afforum.org/sites/default/files/English/English_118.pdf,

12564,"ForestWater Relations in Central Africa. African Forest Forum, Working Paper Vol. 1 (8).","Central Africa sub-region is much endowed with natural water resources. The region is watered by the four largest watersheds of the continent. These include the Congo River basin, the Nile River basin, the Niger River basin, and Lake Chad basin. However, the overall utilisation rate of these resources is low and this, coupled with effects of climate fluctuations, unsustainable water projects, conflicts, lack of regulation and mismanagement, has increased food insecurity and worsened the livelihoods of the people. Besides, very few studies have reported on the relationship between forests and water resources in this region, but it is acknowledged that watershed forests play important role in the regulation of the stream flows, by absorbing water from high rainfalls and releasing it slowly through drier periods. Overall, there is a need to understand the interactions between forests and water in watersheds, to raise awareness and build capacity in forest hydrology, to develop institutional mechanisms to enhance synergies in forests and water issues, and to implement and enforce national and regional action programs.
As part of its contribution to managing the African forests sustainably, as well as generating and sharing knowledge and information for sustainable forest management, the African Forest Forum commissioned a study on the broad area of forestwater relations, covering the Sahelian region. The issues addressed in this study include: the extent of shared commitment to and desire to promote synergy and strengthen cooperation of the member states on water, water issues in the sub-region, water supply in the region as related to forest ecosystems, learning and sharing of experiences and best practices, potential for collaboration in managing and using water resources and related forest ecosystems in the sub-region. This was essentially a desk study primarily aimed at identifying the major water resources in the sub-region, how they are linked to various forest ecosystems that serve as water catchment forests, and challenges and opportunities in managing these forests to improve supply of quality water to the sub-region.
This report provides a modest initial step in this direction, by highlighting key aspects related to the link between these two resources, as well as some issues that could be addressed by various stakeholders including researchers, local communities and policy makers. It has been made possible through collaborative efforts of the African Forest Forum and Dr. Jean Lagarde Betti was responsible for writing this report.

12565,"ForestWater Relations in the Sahel. African Forest Forum, Working Paper  Vol. 1 (7)","The Sahel region is endowed with a lot of water resources from rivers, permanent water ponds and rich aquifers. These water resources are interconnected with forest resources either at national or sub-regional levels and control the productive capacity and the livelihoods of the populations. In the Sahel the most important watersheds and river basins are the Niger River basin, the Lake Chad watershed, the Senegal River basin, the Gambia River Basin and the Volta River Basin. Each country of the sub-region shares international water with its related forest ecosystems. A basic weakness in all the river basin commissions or authorities is a lack of political will. The compelling evidence of the degradation of most of the rivers and their basins, and the urgency of the need for restoration, has stimulated member countries to muster some political will to cooperate. Most of the policies and institutions required to prevent environmental degradation, and promote sustainable development, are similar throughout the sub-region and a number of community projects are ongoing or planned in which stakeholders are involved at various stages. As part of its contribution to managing the African forests sustainably, as well as generating and sharing knowledge and information for sustainable forest management, the African Forest Forum commissioned a study on the broad area of forestwater relations, covering the Sahelian region.

12566,"Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and trade in Central Africa. African Forest Forum, Working Paper  Vol. 1 (10)","There is no doubt the Central Africa sub-region is rich in forest resources. The total cover of dense forests in Congo, DR Congo, Gabon, Central African Republic, Equatorial Guinea, and Cameroon is about 162 million ha out of which the dense forests of the DRC, the largest ones, cover 99 million ha, about 61% of the total dense forest area. With its forest resources, Central Africa produced nearly 8.4 million m³ of timber. These important resources have for a long period contributed to population welfare in the sub-region. Unfortunately, Illegal logging has been clearly pointed out as an important cause of deforestation which negatively impacts on forest-dependent people in Central Africa sub-region. Moreover, the current legal and institutional frameworks are weak and enforcement of provisions problematic. In fact, coping with good governance in natural resources management has been challenging and problems arise when laws are incoherent, unrealistic and unenforceable, and fail to address forest land tenure and use rights.
Forest Law Enforcement and Governance and Trade (FLEGT) was initiated in 2003 by the European Commission (EU) as a comprehensive Action Plan that can set up a sustainable reform in the forestry sector, through legislation and markets and basically built upon voluntary agreements and strong commitment of producer countries. In furtherance of its mission and commitment to managing the African forests in sustainable manner, as well as generating and sharing knowledge and information for Sustainable Forest Management, the African Forest Forum commissioned a study to assess the status and performance of FLEGT and its impact on Sustainable Forest Management in the Central Africa sub-region.
This report covers an introduction to FLEGT, status of forests in the study area, including key elements of forest policy and legislation, challenges and opportunities for socioeconomic development and environmental protection in forestry. The report also addresses the status of FLEGT in selected countries and proffers the way forward to optimizing the benefits of FLEGT. It represents a very significant contribution to the discourse on FLEGT and indeed Sustainable Forest Management in Central Africa and credit should go to Dr. Jean Lagarde Betti who prepared it on behalf of the African Forest Forum.

12567,"Vulnerability of biophysical and socioeconomic systems in moist tropical forests in west and central Africa to climate change. African Forest Forum. Working Paper, Vol. 2 (13)","Tropical forest of Africa represents 18% of the world total and covers over 3.6 million km2 in West, East and Central Africa. The bulk of tropical forests in Africa are found in West and Central Africa with the forests in Congo Basin of containing the largest remaining
contiguous expanse of moist tropical forests (MTFs) in Africa and the second largest in the world after the Amazon forest.
The West and Central African MTFs are characterized by annual rainfall of 1,400 - 4000 mm, and include moist deciduous and rain forests at low altitudes and Afromontane broadleaved forests at higher altitudes (&gt; 900 m elevation). A large fraction of populations who live in rural areas depend on the MTFs for many of their subsistence and export of timber, and non-timber forest products generate income for countries in West and Central Africa.
The large expanse of MTFs in West and Central Africa holds much of Africas carbon, and the general vulnerability of the people and economies make the sub-regions important for consideration in terms of impacts from climate change. However, lack of accurate climate forecasting makes it difficult to accurately predict future conditions of climates in the subregions. But, there is still a need to consider the likely impacts of climate change on forests and the people who are dependent on forest products and services in order to put in place adaptive strategies for the people.
Climatic records show that the African continent is warmer than it was 100 years ago with warming of approximately 0.7 °C in most of the continent during the 20th Century, a decrease in rainfall over large portions of the Sahel and increase in rainfall in east-central
Africa. During this century, this warming trend and changes in precipitation patterns are expected to continue accompanied by a rise in sea level and increased frequency of extreme weather events.
The changes in temperature and rainfall will alter the environmental conditions to which trees in MTFs in Central and West Africa are adapted and expose them to new pests and diseases. The rich biodiversity, some of which concentrated in several centres of endemism of the MTFs, is at risk through extinction of species as a result of climate change.","Muoghalu, I.

Working Paper  Vol. 2 (19),"With the decision on the Reduction of Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) in COP-16 in Cancun, the contribution of forests to climate change has been recognized as a cornerstone of the post-2012 climate change agenda. REDD+ includes policy approaches and positive incentives on issues relating to reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries, and recognizes the contribution of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in achieving REDD+ objectives. The mangroves, with their unique characteristics hold some potential for realizing the aims of REDD+.
This study involved literature work on the extent and prevalence of the mangroves in West and Central Africa, to be able to determine their present status, ownerships, local uses and national policies governing them. This served as the basis for the assessment and analysis of implementation of REDD+ in the sub-regions. Online sources and interviews of key informants were employed for data gathering on people's perceptions of the mangrove forests, the uses to which they are put, their contributions to livelihoods and anthropogenic factors affecting their sustainable management. Data and information germane to REDD+ in the countries, where mangrove forests exist, were sourced on such issues as Policy, Methodologies, Finance and Adaptation to, and Mitigation of climate Change impacts. Extant national forest policies in relation to ownership, use and conservation of the mangroves were analyzed to know how they impact climate change, and in particular, REDD+ schemes, with a view to up-scaling proven best options.",Popoola L.,2014,Working Paper,20401,8/24/2022 6:13,https://afforum.org/oldaff/sites/default/files/English/English_111.pdf,https://afforum.org/oldaff/sites/default/files/French/French_65.pdf
12569,Vulnerability of biosphysical and socioeconomic systems in savannahs and woodlands of West and Central Africa to climate change. Working Paper  Vol. 2 (14),"Tropical woodlands and savannahs are associated with areas where there is an annual dry season of sufficient duration and intensity, and most of woody plants shed their leaves and grasses dry out. The accumulations of the dry fuel permits fires every year, and the fires help prevent complete domination by woody plants. These ecosystems are overexploited as a result of crop farming and/or overgrazing associated with fuelwood gathering. Africa is composed essentially of woodlands and savannahs with rain forests occupying 7% of the land area. They occur extensively in West and Central Africa. The woodlands and savannahs serve important ecological functions and provide wood and non-wood forest products that contribute significantly to human well-being at local, national and global levels.
The non-wood products include fruits, vegetables, nuts seeds, roots, mushroom, spices, bush meat, bee products, edible insects, eggs and medicines, which are particularly important in the lives of the communities dwelling in them. The products also play important roles in the national economies of many countries of West and Central Africa. Agriculture, i.e. crop production and animal husbandry, is the main occupation of the rural dwellers in these ecosystems that depend on the produce for subsistence and income. Much of the crop land is rain-fed and, therefore, vulnerable to climate variability that is characterized by periodic droughts and occasional floods that frequently cause crop failures during which the coping strategy of inhabitants is gathering of wild foods and resources from the vegetation. Maintaining the flow of these goods and services requires healthy ecosystems in the face of human-induced climate change. Already, scientific evidence in Africa shows that climate change directly impacts on key development sectors, such as water resources, land, forests, biodiversity, tourism and agriculture that are crucial for livelihoods, food, health and security of local communities. Furthermore, future projections indicate that these impacts are likely to worsen overtime.","Muoghalu, I.J.",2014,Working Paper,20412,8/24/2022 11:52,https://afforum.org/oldaff/sites/default/files/English/English_87.pdf,https://afforum.org/oldaff/sites/default/files/French/French_59.pdf

The western Tanzania area is characterized by a heavy grazing by the large number of animals and the use of forests as a source of energy. In addition, information on forest management from other regions of Tanzania was collected, especially, on Participatory Forest Management (PFM). The study showed that natural regeneration through active involvement of local communities promoted under PFM and/or collaborative forest management, and supported by the new forestry legislation, is by far the most successful and promising option for restoration of the large areas of degraded lands in Eastern Africa. This is because local communities are allocated clear forest land rights, and their traditional knowledge and management practices (e.g. Ngitili) are taken into account.","Chirwa, P.

12572,"Review of national plans and programmes related to people, forests and climate change in West Africa. Working Paper Vol. 2 (10),","National Plans and Programmes related to People, Forests and Climate Change in West Africa were reviewed in a desk study, in order to improve understanding of how forests and trees, and the people who depend on them, respond to climate change and variability. The study focused on National Adaptation Plans/Programmes of Action (NAPAs), National Climate Change Strategies, Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs) and National Communications to the UNFCCC, and sought to identify gaps and factors influencing their implementation, and how these could be filled through forestry and forestry-related interventions. The study also examined the profiles and capacities of public forest administrations in the studied West African countries, in terms of human, financial and physical capacities for effective monitoring, reporting and verification in the implementation of multilateral environmental agreements related to forestry and climate change, as well as the extent of participation of women, youth and vulnerable groups in forest based climate change response actions and how these could be enhanced. All countries in West Africa are parties to the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol. All, except Liberia, have submitted their Initial/First National Communication and 11 of them have
submitted the Second National Communication. All 15 Least Developed Countries (LDCs) in the sub-region have submitted NAPAs and two of the non-LDCs have elaborated national adaptation strategies with implementation plans. Only six of the countries have responded to the Copenhagen Accord requirement for submission of Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs). Common constraints to implementation of the plans are shortage of funds and human resources, poor knowledge base and institutional bottlenecks. For many countries the involvement of forestry is not explicitly highlighted in their climate change response plans. Along with harnessing external support to improve financial and technical capacity, and applying the funds gained to building human (by education and training), research and institutional capacities, recognition of the role of forestry, and investment to strengthen this role will have a widespread positive influence in achieving the goals of many of the listed climate change response measures in the sub-region.
Only Burkina Faso and Senegal have good forest inventory capacity. Niger has some, but the rest of the countries have limited or very low forest inventory capacities Also, the majority (12 out of 18) of the countries studied have very low forest area monitoring
capacities, as judged by shortcomings in consistency, transparency, comparability, completeness and accuracy of reports they have returned to bodies such as FAO, UNFCCC and the World Bank. Most (11) of the countries with low forest area monitoring capacity are among the LDCs. It is suggested that the low capacities observed partly reflect a long tradition of neglect of inventory, monitoring and reporting in forest practice in most African countries, including the West African countries studied. The capacity building required to overcome this is not just in terms of skills, tools and facilities, but also in terms of national re-orientation, and particularly of the forestry services. Except in countries where cultural norms restrict women from taking part in field activities,
women, youth and the poor traditionally participate actively in forestry activities, including those done in response to climate change, e.g. nursery work, planting tree seedlings, watering and tending seedlings as well as monitoring agroforestry practices and protecting naturally regenerated seedlings. Women and youth also dominate in collecting, processing and marketing non-timber forest products (NTFPs). To increase the roles and benefits to women, youth and vulnerable groups in forest-based climate change response programmes, emphasis should be given to developing NTFP-based enterprises into a viable commercial industry sector that can take advantage of international market opportunities. Designing the emerging REDD+ mechanism to accommodate such a development, accompanied with policy reforms to address constraints to women's participation in forestry, such as restricted land and tree tenure rights, poor representation of women in important decision-making structures and poor access to information, will help to sustain the increase in participation and benefits to women from forest-based responses to climate change. Arising from the findings of this study, critical areas for further attention by AFF would be: to conduct a more detailed assessment than was feasible in the present study, to identify specific forestry interventions, and how to implement them, in the priority NAPA projects and climate change response strategies and actions developed by West African countries, with a view to recommending such interventions to the relevant countries; to organise a programme of sensitisation, re-orientation and training of West African countries on the importance of forest inventory, monitoring, reporting and verification of forest cover changes in implementing sustainable forest management and forest-based responses to climate change; and, to initiate and promote research into the development of NTFP-based enterprises into a viable commercial industry sector dominated by women and youth and linked with the implementation of forest-based climate change responses such as the REDD mechanism or in NAMAs in West Africa countries.","Okali, D.",2014,Working Paper,20419,8/24/2022 12:35,https://afforum.org/oldaff/sites/default/files/English/English_113.pdf,https://afforum.org/oldaff/sites/default/files/French/French_67.pdf

12577,Non-Wood Forest Products and Services for Socio-Economic Development:A Compendium for Technical and Professional Forestry Education,"A pan-African initiative on Sustainable Forest Management in Africa (SFM) was implemented between 2003 and 2008, with funding from the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida). The overall aim of the initiative was to learn from experiences in implementing SFM in Africa and evaluate how to upscale the positive lessons. The initiative was jointly implemented by the African Forest Research Network (AFORNET) at the African Academy of Sciences (AAS), the Royal Swedish Academy of Agriculture and Forestry (KSLA) and the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations, in collaboration with many national and regional institutions in Africa as well as some other international institutions.
One of the key findings from this initiative is that Africa continues to have serious problems with generating new information and innovations in forestry, accessing externally available information, as well as with analysing and adopting such information and innovation into practical forest management. There are pockets of information in many institutions, networks and individuals. However, a mechanism to systematically collect, collate, synthesise (where necessary) and share the information is lacking. Such information would not only enrich educational establishments, which mould future foresters, agriculturalists, environmentalists and other stakeholders in forestry, but will also be useful for decision-makers and practitioners in forestry, environmental protection, rural development, and related areas.
In this regard the SFM initiative collected a substantial amount of information on Non-Wood Forest Products and Services (NWFPS). It was felt that this information was not available in a way that could facilitate its use by educational and training institutions for technical and professional education in forestry and related areas. A team composed of the following members examined the information and proposed ways of enriching and developing it into a teaching compendium for both technical and professional training: Prof. Daniel N. Sifuna, Dr. James B. Kungu and Dr. Teresa Aloo (Kenyatta University, Kenya); Dr. Joel Laigong and Dr. Kingiri Senelwa (Moi University, Kenya); Ms. Jane K. Kaaria (Kenya Forestry College, Londiani, Kenya); Dr. Tsegaye Bekele (Wondo Genet College of Forestry, Ethiopia); Dr. Abdalla A. Elfeel (College of Forestry and Range Science, Khartoum, Sudan); Mr. Bennet Mataya (Mzuzu University, Malawi); Prof. John Kaboggoza (Makerere University, Uganda); Mr. Isaya Mnangwone (Forestry Training Institute, Olmotonyi, Tanzania); Prof. August Temu (World Agroforestry Centre, Nairobi, Kenya) and; Ms Agnes Lusweti and Prof. Godwin Kowero (Sustainable Forest Management in Africa Initiative, Nairobi, Kenya). Prof. Sifuna provided the pedagogical guidance in writing the compendium.
The initial draft of the compendium was put up by Dr. Kingiri Senelwa (Moi University, Kenya), Mr. Bennet Mataya (Mzuzu University, Malawi) and Dr. Suzana Augustino (Sokoine University of Agriculture, Tanzania). They are collectively responsible for the contents of the compendium. The African Forest Forum (AFF), upon expiry of the SFM initiative, took up the responsibility for moving this process forward. The draft compendium was reviewed by Dr. Phosiso Sola (Southern Alliance for Indigenous Resources), Dr. Jean Lagarde Betti (University of Douala, Cameroon), Prof. Labode Popoola (University of Ibadan), Dr. Julius Chupezi (FAO-Cameroon), Dr. Abasse Tougiani (INRAN/CERRA, Maradi, Niger), Dr. Ben Chikamai (Kenya Forestry Research Institute, Kenya); Dr.
Yonas Yemshaw, Dr. Mahamane Larwanou and Prof. Godwin Kowero (African Forest Forum). The final editing, graphics reproduction, layout, and production were done by Dr. Enoch Achigan-Dako (Plant Resources of Tropical Africa-PROTANairobi).
This compendium is not written as a paper for scientific journal publication, but as scientific information drawn from various sources and presented in a pedagogical manner to facilitate uptake of the same by students and their instructors. Information dispersed in various writings on the subject has been collated and systematically synthesised into chapters that focus on certain topics and in a sequence that facilitates the understanding of the industry of Non-Wood Forest Products and Services. Hopefully this compendium will provide incentives for others to write books that will address the needs of teachers and students on the same and similar issues. The compendium aims at enabling students and other interested groups including government officials, producers, exporters, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), research institutes and other stakeholders to acquire knowledge, skills, and values in the identification, development, management, utilisation and promotion of opportunities in NWFPS.

12578,"Pre-XIV World Forestry Congress Workshop Forests, People and Environment: Some Perspectives from Africa 4-5 September 2015 Durban, South Africa - Book of abstracts.","In Africa, nearly all issues in the forestry debate of today revolve, directly or indirectly, around deforestation and forest degradation. Although current information as reported by FAO indicates a decrease in net forest loss in Africa, deforestation still remains a key
challenge in many countries. It is important to understand the broader context in which deforestation, forest and land degradation are taking place, and especially why they are so rapid in Africa as compared to other continents.
Understanding the changing role of forests and forestr  requires a broader analysis of the state of society as defined by key features like production, consumption and the state of technology employed. Throughout the history of human civilisation, people have used
forests and trees for a variety of purposes  economic, social, environmental, cultural and spiritual. This would imply that what is appropriate at a given point of time may cease to be so as circumstances change. As in the case of other regions, the society  forest relationship (society/forestry nexus) in Africa also remains highly dynamic and there is a whole range of interventions resulting in multifarious outcomes with differing consequences on society and forests. Resource use priorities therefore differ considerably.
Broadly, societies can be grouped into four categories namely: forest dependent communities, agrarian societies, industrial societies and post-industrial societies. The principle uses of forests and the production and consumption characteristics of these societies differ considerably.Every country or region has differing proportions of people in each category. In general forestdependent and agrarian societies characterise most sub-Sahara African countries, while the proportion of industrial and post-industrial segment is low. This is in sharp contrast to most of the developed countries, where post-industrial and industrial societies dominate. Resource use priorities therefore differ considerably. Often some of the conflicts in resource use stem
from application of concepts and approaches to resource-use that are not seen as important from the perception of the dominant groups.
Due to the predominance of the agrarian society in most sub-Sahara African countries, the linkage between agriculture and forestry is rather strong, and what happens to forests is largely determined by what happens to agriculture. And as industrialisation progresses, forests have to cater to another array of needs; for example, to supply wood and non-wood products, as well as other ecosystem goods and services including carbon sequestration, biodiversity conservation, among others. On the other hand, the needs of a post-industrial society are somewhat different, with environmental and cultural aspects becoming more important. Depending on the proportion of societies in the different categories, the pressures and conflicts on the use of forests differ. A change in the proportion of different segments in society and changes in their perception of the use of forests will be most fundamental in determining the future of forests.
This booklet highlights developments in African forestry by these different societies. Also included are mechanisms that can enhance the roles of forests and trees in national eeconomic development and poverty alleviation, improve food security and nutrition, secure environmental stability and protect forest values on the continent. These are presented guided by the following themes: rehabilitation of degraded lands using trees; managing forests in the context of climate change; forest governance, marketing and trade in forest products; and socio-economic issues in forestry.

12579,Biofuel initiatives in West Africa and the Sahel: potential for success.  In International Forestry Review Vol.17 (S3),"Summary
Global warming has heightened the need to substitute fossil fuels with biomass-based energy sources. Some West African countries have recorded appreciable progress in this regard though with inadequate documentation. This study documents the extent of production and use of different biofuels and incentives for sustainability in the sub-region. Field visits were conducted in Benin, Ghana, Niger and Nigeria with the aid of structured questionnaire and focus group discussions; and literature search in Mali, Niger and Senegal to assess current scenarios. Biofuel crop production (jatropha, cassava and sugarcane) is on the rise, howbeit, with foreign investments. That cassava and sugarcane are important staples in the sub-region constitutes a possible hindrance to their adoption, arising from food crisis currently being experienced there. Jatropha appears the most appropriate potential species. There is the need for enabling policies to enhance the optimum production and utilization of Jatropha for biofuel production in the sub-region.

Certains pays de lAfrique de louest ont enregistré des progrès notables à cet égard, bien que la documentation en soit inadéquate. Cette étude documente létendue de la production et de lutilisation de différents biocarburants, et des mesures incitatives à leur durabilité dans la région inférieure. Des visites sur le terrain ont été effectuées au Bénin, au Ghana, au Niger et au Nigéria, avec lassistance dun questionnaire structuré et de groupes de discussion, ainsi quavec une recherche dans la littérature du Mali, du Niger et du Sénégal, pour évaluer les scénarios actuels. La récolte de biocarburants (jatropha, cassave et canne à sucre) est en augmentation, mais, il faut le noter, avec laide dinvestissements étrangers. Le fait que la cassave et la canne à sucre soient des denrées vitales importantes dans la région inférieure est un facteur restreignant leur adoption, du fait de la crise alimentaire actuellement vécue dans cette région. Des politiques de facilitation sont nécessaires pour améliorer lutilisation et une production optimale de la jatropha en tant que génératrice de biocarburant dans la région inférieure de lAfrique de louest.

La producción de cultivos para biocombustible (jatropha, yuca y caña de azúcar) está en aumento, aunque debido a inversiones extranjeras. El hecho de que la yuca y la caña de azúcar sean alimentos básicos importantes en la subregión constituye un posible obstáculo para su adopción, a raíz de la crisis alimentaria que se vive allí en la actualidad. Jatropha parece ser la especie potencialmente más apropiada.

12580,Market potential of non-wood forest products in the Sahelian countries.  In International Forestry Review Vol.17 (S3),"Summary
Non-wood forest products (NWFPs) are important sources of dietary supplement in all countries of the Sahel. The most valued forest products are gum Arabic (Acacia Senegal, Shea butter (Vitellaria paradoxa), the Nere (Parkia biglobosa), honey and others. On the economic and wealth creation level, NWFPs are used to generate significant financial returns, especially in rural areas. Collection of NWFPs for commercial purposes is primarily an off-season business and generates additional revenue, especially during the period of food shortage. The NWFPs are an important source of income for women in a number of countries in the Sahel region with an example of gum arabic market in Niger. While the majority of NWFPs are collected without restriction as common products, there is a tendency to move from common to private property ownership with NWFPs of major economic values. In order to boost production and marketing, there is need to have: (i) adequate resources to meet the growing demand for these products, (ii) well trained and equipped producers / collectors, (iii) well-structured and funded value chains, and (iv) well defined and organised markets.

Le potentiel du marché des produits forestiers non ligneux dans les pays du Sahel
A. MAISHAROU et M. Larwanou
Les produits forestiers non-ligneux (PFNL) sont des sources importantes de complément alimentaire dans tous les pays du Sahel dontles plus appréciés sont la gomme arabique (Acacia Senegal), le beurre de karité (Vitellaria paradoxa), le Nere (Parkia biglobosa), le miel et autres. Sur le plan économique et de création de richesse, les PFNL sont utilisés pour générer des revenus financiers importants, en particulier dans les zones rurales. La collecte des PFNL à des fins commerciales est principalement une activité hors-saison et génère des revenus supplémentaires, surtout pendant la période de pénurie alimentaire. Les PFNL sont une source importante de revenus pour les femmes dans un certain nombre de pays de la région du Sahel avec un exemple du marché de la gomme arabique au Niger. Bien que la majorité des PFNL soient collectés sans restriction des produits communs, il y a une tendance à passer de commun à la propriété privée surtout avec les PFNL ayant de grandes valeurs économiques. Afin de stimuler la production et la commercialisation, il est nécessaire davoir: (i) les ressources adéquates pour répondre à la demande croissante pour ces produits, (ii) les producteurs et les collecteurs bien formés et équipés, (iii), les chaînes de valeur bien structurés et financés, et (iv) les marchés bien définis et organisés.
Los mercados de productos forestales no maderables como medio de reducción de la pobreza en los países del Sahel

Los productos forestales más valorados son la goma arábiga (Acacia senegal), la manteca de karité (Vitellaria paradoxa), el néré (Parkia biglobosa), y la miel, entre otros. En el plano económico y de creación de riqueza, los PFNM se emplean para generar rendimientos financieros considerables, sobre todo en las zonas rurales. La recolección de PFNM con fines comerciales es ante todo un negocio de fuera de temporada con el que generar ingresos adicionales, especialmente durante el período de escasez de alimentos. Los PFNM son una fuente importante de ingresos para las mujeres en varios países de la región del Sahel, como por ejemplo el mercado de goma arábiga en Níger. Mientras que la mayoría de los PFNM se recolectan sin restricción por ser bienes comunales, hay una tendencia a pasar de la propiedad comunal a la privada cuando se trata de PFNM de alto valor económico. Con el fin de impulsar la producción y la comercialización, se necesitan: (I) recursos adecuados para satisfacer la demanda creciente de estos productos; (ii) productores y recolectores bien entrenados y equipados; (iii) cadenas de valor bien estructuradas y financiadas; y (iv) mercados bien definidos y organizados.","Maisharou, A., & Larwanou, M.",2015,Journal Article,,8/23/2022 9:42,https://afforum.org/oldaff/sites/default/files/English/English_20.pdf,
12581,An overview of intra-African trade in forest products: opportunities and challenges.  In International Forestry Review Vol.17 (S3),"Summary
The emerging scenario in intra-African trade in forest products is one characterised by very small volumes of recorded trade on one hand, and on the other one of unrecorded, and of potentially big sales, taking place across borders. There has been considerable attention and resources put on condemning and containing the latter, which is illegal; and less so on understanding its causes, its niche in socio-economic development, and ways to tame it as formal trade. Africa needs to cultivate a conducive environment that includes favourable policies and infrastructure for legalising such trade, and in ways that its actors can be better organised and regulated. This has great potential to benefit more people and national incomes through taxes which are currently avoided, as well as containing illegal logging and wood processing that continues to decimate the forest estate. Superimposed on this is the apparent failure to strengthen even the current small legal intra-African trade in forest products, and this is mainly due to poor infrastructure that hinders broader continental economic integration. There is also an apparent and very serious neglect of the potential of firewood and charcoal production and trade to be legitimate, dynamic and fully legalised, mainstreamed, modernised activities  anchored on sustainable raw material provision, given that these energy products are essential for Africas rapidly growing population, both in rural and urban areas. Charcoal is not a fuel of history but of the African future. There is therefore need to develop
legally organized sustainable production and marketing systems.

Une vue densemble du commerce intra-africain en produits forestiers: défis et opportunités
M.E. CHIPETA et G. KOWERO
Le scénario émergeant du commerce intra-africain en produits forestiers est caractérisé dun côté par de très faibles volumes de commerce répertorié et, dun autre côté, par de grandes ventes potentielles seffectuant dune frontière à lautre. Une attention et des ressources considérables ont été accordées pour tout à la fois condamner et contenir ces dernières, qui sont illégales, mais beaucoup moins pour essayer de comprendre leur cause, leur niche dans le développement socio-économique, et les moyens de lintégrer au sein du commerce formel. LAfrique doit cultiver un environnement encourageant, incluant des infrastructures et des politiques favorables à légaliser de tels commerces, et capables daider ses acteurs à être mieux organisés et régularisés. Ce secteur possède un fort potentiel bénéfique pour davantage de personnes et pour les revenus nationaux, à laide dimpôts actuellement évités, ainsi que pour le contrôle de la coupe de bois et sa manufacture illégales, qui continuent à décimer le bien forestier. Il faut ajouter à ceci léchec apparent de fortifier même les petits commerces intra-africains actuels légaux en produits forestiers, dû principalement à une infrastructure pauvre empêchant une intégration économique continentale plus large. Il existe également une négligence visible et très sérieuse du potentiel quont la production et le commerce de bois de chauffe et de charbon dêtre rendues activités modernes courantes, légitimes, dynamiques et pleinement légales, ancrées sur une provision de matériau brut durable, du fait que ces produits énergétiques sont essentiels pour la population africaine en rapide croissance dans les zones urbaines ainsi que rurales. Le charbon nest pas un carburant du passé, mais bien présent dans le futur de l Afrique. Il existe par conséquent un besoin de développer des systèmes de production et de marketing durables et organisés légalement.
Una visión general del comercio de productos forestales entre países africanos: oportunidades y retos
M.E. CHIPETA y G. KOWERO
El panorama emergente del comercio de productos forestales entre países africanos se caracteriza por un lado por volúmenes de comercio registrado muy pequeños, y por otro por posibles grandes ventas no registradas que tienen lugar a través de las fronteras. A estas últimas se les ha prestado mucha atención y recursos en cuanto a censurar y frenar las que son ilegales, pero mucha menos a la comprensión de sus causas, a su papel de nicho en el desarrollo socioeconómico, y a las maneras de domesticarlas en forma de comercio formal. África necesita cultivar un ambiente propicio que incluya políticas favorables y la infraestructura para la legalización de ese comercio, mediante maneras que permitan a sus actores estar mejor organizados y regulados. Esto tiene un gran potencial para beneficiar a un mayor número personas y a los ingresos nacionales por medio de evitar la elusión fiscal actual, así como frenar la tala y la transformación ilegal de la madera, que continúan diezmando la superficie forestal. En paralelo a esto se observa el fracaso evidente en cuanto a fortalecer el pequeño comercio legal de productos forestales entre países africanos, lo que se debe principalmente a la mala infraestructura que dificulta una integración económica continental más amplia. También se aprecia el abandono evidente y muy grave del potencial que tiene la producción y el comercio de leña y carbón de convertirse en actividades modernas, integradas, totalmente legalizadas, dinámicas y legítimas sustentadas por una producción de materias
primas sostenibles, dado que estos productos energéticos son esenciales para las población africana en rápido crecimiento, tanto en zonas rurales como urbanas. El carbón no es un combustible del pasado, sino del futuro de África. Por tanto, es necesario desarrollar sistemas de producción y comercialización sostenibles legalmente organizados.","Chipeta, M.E., & Kowero, G",2015,Journal Article,20395,8/23/2022 10:04,https://afforum.org/oldaff/sites/default/files/English/English_99.pdf,
12582,An overview of nationally appropriate mitigation actions (NAMAs) and national adaptation programmes of action (NAPAs) in Africa.  In International Forestry Review Vol.17 (S3),"Summary
The global initiative to manage forests in response to climate change emanated from the seventh and thirteenth Conference of the Parties (COP 7 and 13) under the aegis of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This paper focuses on the role of forests and forestry in adaptation to climate change through NAPAs and in mitigation through NAMAs in sub-Saharan Africa, and is based on a review of published literature and commissioned papers. In general, climate change is now a well-recognized phenomenon in Africa and has been incorporated in environmental policies and strategies in virtually all sub-Saharan countries of Africa. However, the policies of key sectors such as agriculture, infra-structure, energy and others, have not reflected or made practical programmatic adjustments in response to climate change to the extent that the urgency of climate change would suggest.
The urgency for adaptation to climate change has spawned a wide interest in NAPAs and in that regard, the majority of projects of country NAPAs are in sectors other than forestry, with a few exceptions in the NAPAs of East and Southern Africa. In mitigation based NAMAs, forestry is predictably dominant through REDD+, even though low carbon prices seem to be a disincentive at the moment. To improve the recognition and practical role of forestry, in climate change adaptation and mitigation, the forest sector at individual country levels, should further articulate evidence-based information on the role of forests in adaptation, target the agriculture sector for tree and forest-based adaptation, raise the profile of the forest sector in poverty reduction, use data for policy advocacy and engage sectors linked to drivers of forest cover change in order to safeguard forest ecosystems against injudicious losses.

Une vue densemble des actions appropriées datténuation au niveau national et des programmes nationaux daction dadaptation en Afrique
H.O. KOJWANG and M.LARWANOU
Linitiative mondiale pour gérer les forêts en réponse au changement climatique émanait de la septième et treizième Conférence des Parties (CDP 7 et 13) sous légide de la Convention Cadre des Nations Unies sur les changements climatiques (CCNUCC). Ce document met laccent sur le rôle des forêts et la foresterie dans ladaptation au changement climatique à travers les PANAs et dans latténuation à travers les NAMAs en Afrique sub-saharienne, et est basée sur une revue de la littérature publiée et des documents commandés. En général, le changement climatique est maintenant un phénomène bien connu en Afrique et a été intégré dans les politiques et stratégies environnementales dans pratiquement tous les pays dAfrique sub-saharienne. Cependant, les politiques des secteurs clés tels que lagriculture, linfrastructure, lénergie et autres, nont pas reflété ou fait des ajustements programmatiques concrets en réponse au changement climatique au point où lurgence du changement climatique suggère. Lurgence pour ladaptation au changement climatique a engendré un large intérêt dans les PANA, et à cet égard, la majorité des projets PANA des pays sont dans des secteurs autres que la foresterie, à quelques exceptions près dans les PANA de lAfrique orientale et australe.
Dans les NAMAs relatifs à latténuation, la foresterie est dominante à travers la REDD+, même si les prix faibles démissions de carbone semblent avoir un effet dissuasif pour le moment. Pour améliorer la reconnaissance et le rôle pratique de la foresterie en adaptation au changement climatique et latténuation, le secteur forestier au niveau des pays individuels, devrait disposer des informations fondées sur des preuves sur le rôle des forêts dans ladaptation, cibler le secteur de lagriculture pour ladaptation basée sur les arbres et les forêts, rehausser le profil du secteur forestier dans la réduction de la pauvreté, utiliser les données pour le plaidoyer politique et engager les secteurs liés aux moteurs de changement du couvert forestier afin de préserver les écosystèmes forestiers contre les pertes inconsidérées.
Una visión general de las acciones nacionales apropiadas de mitigación y los programas nacionales de acción para la adaptación en África
H.O. KOJWANG y M. LARWANOU
La iniciativa global para la gestión de los bosques en respuesta al cambio climático surgió de la séptima y la decimotercera Conferencia de las Partes (COP 7 y 13), bajo los auspicios de la Convención Marco de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Cambio Climático (CMNUCC). Este artículo se centra en la función de los bosques y la silvicultura en la adaptación al cambio climático a través de los programas nacionales de acción para la adaptación (NAPA, por sus siglas en inglés) y en la mitigación mediante acciones nacionales apropiadas de mitigación (NAMA, por sus siglas en inglés) en el África subsahariana, y se basa en una revisión de la literatura publicada y artículos comisionados sobre el tema. En general, el cambio climático es hoy en día un fenómeno bien conocido en África, que prácticamente se ha incorporado a las políticas y estrategias ambientales de todos los países del África subsahariana. Sin embargo, las políticas de sectores clave como la agricultura, la infraestructura, la energía y otros, no han reflejado o realizado ajustes programáticos prácticos en respuesta al cambio climático en la medida de la urgencia sugerida por el cambio climático.
La urgencia para la adaptación al cambio climático ha generado un amplio interés en los NAPA y, en ese sentido, la mayoría de los proyectos de los NAPA de los países pertenecen a sectores distintos de la silvicultura, salvo algunas excepciones en los NAPA de África Oriental y Meridional. En las NAMA que están basadas en la mitigación, no sorprende que la silvicultura predomina
mediante el programa REDD+, a pesar de que los bajos precios del carbono parecen ser un desincentivo en este momento. Para mejorar el reconocimiento y la función práctica de la silvicultura en la adaptación al cambio climático y la mitigación, el sector forestal de cada país debería ofrecer información con base en pruebas más elocuentes sobre la función de los bosques en la adaptación, trabajar con el sector agrícola en la adaptación con base en los árboles y el bosque, promover el sector forestal como medio para la reducción de la pobreza, utilizar datos para la promoción de políticas e involucrar a los sectores vinculados a las causas del cambio en la cubierta forestal a fin de salvaguardar los ecosistemas forestales frente a pérdidas imprudentes.","Kojwang, H.

12583,Forestry-related input into relevant policies at the regional and global levels: an African perspective on climate change.  In International Forestry Review Vol.17 (S3),"Summary
This paper describes regional forestry and forestry-related policies of the Sub-Saharan Region of Africa, with a view to reveal and discuss their influence on both regionional cooperation, national programmes and the participation of women, children and the vulnerable in forestry practice. All Regional Economic Commissions (RECs) of Sub-Saharan Africa have regional forestry policies which are reflected in Forest Convergence Plans (Central and West Africa), special commissions such as COMIFAC of Central Africa, policies and protocols (East and Southern Africa). The Great Green Wall of the Sahara and Sahel Initiative (GGWSSI) is also relevant. Despite promising developments in Central Africa, through programmes promoted under COMIFAC and those promoted in southern Africa by SADC, the influence of regional policies on the development of national actions still remains weak and should be strengthened by increased national actions. Linking forestry to climate change adaption and mitigation in addition to traditional economic activities associated efforts would seem to offer new opportunities. Recommendations on how to improve the influence of these policies and promote the gainful participation of women, children and the vulnerable in forestry are suggested.

Contributions didées liées à la foresterie dans des politiques appropriées aux niveaux régionaux et global: une perspective africaine du changement climatique
H. OCHIENG KOJWANG et L. MAHAMANE
Ce papier décrit les politiques de foresterie régionale et celles liées à la foresterie dans la région subsaharienne de lAfrique, et vise à révéler et examiner leur influence sur la coopération régionale, les programmes nationaux et la participation des femmes, des enfants et des personnes vulnérables dans la pratique de la foresterie. Toutes les Commissions économiques régionales (RECs) de lAfrique subsaharienne ont des politiques de foresterie régionales qui sont reflétées dans les Plans de convergence forestiers (Afrique centrale et de louest), dans des commissions spéciales, telles que le COMIFAC de lAfrique centrale, des politiques et des protocoles (Afrique de lest et du sud). Linitiative du Grand mur vert du Sahara et du Sahel (GGWSSI) est également pertinente. Malgré des développements prometteurs en Afrique centrale, au travers des programmes promus sous légide du COMIFAC et ceux promus dans le sud du continent par le SADC, linfluence des politiques régionales sur le développement dactions au niveau national demeure faible et devrait être renforcée par un accroissement des actions nationales. Il semblerait quune association de la foresterie à ladaptation au changement climatique et à son atténuation, ajoutée aux efforts traditionnels dactivités économiques y étant associés, pourrait offrir de nouvelles opportunités. Des recommandations pour améliorer linfluence de ces politiques et promouvoir la participation rémunératrice en foresterie des femmes, des enfants et des personnes vulnérables sont suggérées.
Insumos forestales en las políticas relevantes a nivel regional y mundial: una perspectiva africana sobre el cambio climático
H. OCHIENG KOJWANG y L. MAHAMANE
Este artículo describe las políticas forestales regionales y otras relacionadas con el sector forestal de la región subsahariana de África, con el fin de dar a conocer y debatir su influencia tanto en la cooperación regional, los programas nacionales y la participación de las mujeres, los niños y las personas vulnerables en la práctica forestal. Todas las Comisiones Económicas Regionales (CER) del África subsahariana tienen políticas forestales regionales que se reflejan en los Planes de Convergencia Forestales (África Central y Occidental), las comisiones especiales, como la COMIFAC de África Central, y las políticas y protocolos (África Oriental y del Sur). La Iniciativa de la Gran Muralla Verde para el Sáhara y el Sahel (GMVSS) es también relevante. A pesar de avances prometedores en el África Central, gracias a los programas promovidos por la COMIFAC y los promovidos en el sur de África por la Comunidad de África Meridional para el Desarrollo (SADC), la influencia de las políticas regionales en el desarrollo de acciones a nivel nacional sigue siendo débil y se debe fortalecer con el aumento de acciones nacionales. La vinculación de la silvicultura a la adaptación al cambio climático y su mitigación, además de las labores asociadas a las actividades económicas tradicionales parece ofrecer nuevas oportunidades. Se sugieren recomendaciones sobre cómo mejorar la influencia de estas políticas y promover la participación beneficiosa de las mujeres, los niños y las personas vulnerables en el sector forestal.","Kojwang, H.

12584,Climate vulnerability of socio-economic systems in different forest types and coastal wetlands in Africa: a synthesis.  In International Forestry Review Vol.17 (S3),"Summary
Forests, woodlands and coastal wetlands of Africa serve important ecological functions and provide goods and services that contribute significantly to livelihoods at local, national and global levels. These ecosystems however are vulnerable to climate change impacts that affect their capacity to deliver the ecosystem goods and services. Some impacts will have positive effects and can be taken as opportunities while some will have severe negative impacts that require adequate mitigation measures of the impacts to reduce the impact on the socio-economic systems.
This article reviews the information on climate vulnerability of socio-economic systems in moist forests, woodlands/savannas and coastal wetlands of Africa to identify the likely impacts of climate change on livelihoods. Climate change will have profound impacts on moist forest of Africa including reduction of the capacity of the forests to supply the ecosystem goods and services that contribute to livelihoods and associated socio-economic systems. The water catchment potential of moist forests will be undermined reducing livelihoods associated with water resources. Impacts on woodlands/savannas will undermine the resources available in the woodland for human wellbeing including woodfuel, food, and other materials necessary for human health. Generally climate change will impact negatively the forest and woodland/savannas ecosystems resulting into either direct or indirect effect on the services provided by the ecosystems and associate livelihoods. But also climate impact on agriculture resulting into low production and increased dependence on forests will lead into degradation or expansion of agriculture into forests to compensate for the low production hence deforestation and degradation and more greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
Among the major impacts of climate change on coastal wetlands include reduced water levels and under worst scenarios drying of some wetlands. Given the fact that coastal wetlands support a wide range of livelihood activities such as fisheries and multitude of livelihoods climate change will greatly undermine the capacity of the coastal wetlands to support fisheries and related livelihoods. Such impacts will negatively affect livelihoods and socio-economic systems associated with the coastal resources Monitoring and mitigating the impacts of climate change on the moist forests, woodlands/savannas and coastal wetlands is imperative for sustaining their socio-economic systems and related livelihoods.

La vulnérabilité climatique des systèmes socio-économiques au sein de différents types de forêts et zones humides littorales en Afrique : synthèse
R.A. KITULA, M. LARWANOU, P.K.T. MUNISHI, J.I. MUOGHALU et L. POPOOLA
Les forêts, forêts claires et zones humides littorales de lAfrique jouent dimportants rôles écologiques et fournissent des biens et des services qui contribuent de manière significative aux moyens de subsistance à léchelle locale, nationale et mondiale. Ces écosystèmes sont cependant vulnérables aux impacts du changement climatique, qui a une incidence sur leur capacité à fournir les biens et services écosystémiques. Certains impacts auront des effets positifs et pourront représenter des opportunités, tandis que dautres auront des répercussions négatives sévères nécessitant linstauration de mesures datténuation adéquates afin de réduire leur incidence sur les systèmes socio-économiques.
Cet article passe en revue les informations relatives à la vulnérabilité climatique des systèmes socio-économiques présents dans les forêts humides, les forêts claires/savanes et les zones humides littorales dAfrique afin didentifier les impacts probables du changement climatique sur les moyens de subsistance. Le changement climatique aura des répercussions profondes sur la forêt humide en Afrique, notamment la réduction de la capacité des forêts de fournir les biens et services écosystémiques qui contribuent aux moyens de subsistance et aux systèmes socioéconomiques qui y sont associés. Le potentiel de captage deau des forêts humides sera compromis, réduisant ainsi les moyens de subsistance associés aux ressources en eau. Les impacts sur les forêts claires/savanes affecteront les ressources disponibles dans les forêts claires pour le bien-être des populations, comme les combustibles à base de bois, la nourriture et dautres éléments nécessaires à la santé humaine. De manière générale, le changement climatique aura une incidence négative sur les écosystèmes de la forêt et de la forêt claire/savane, avec pour résultat un effet direct ou indirect sur les services fournis par les écosystèmes et sur les moyens de subsistance qui y sont associés. Limpact climatique sur lagriculture se traduira par une diminution de la production et une dépendance accrue sur les forêts, avec comme conséquence une dégradation ou une expansion de lagriculture dans les forêts afin de compenser la faible production. Cette déforestation et cette dégradation entraineront une augmentation des émissions de gaz à effet de serre (GES).
Lune des principales répercussions du changement climatique sur les zones humides littorales sera la réduction des niveaux deau ; le pire des scénarios prévoit un assèchement de certaines zones humides. Les zones humides littorales soutiennent actuellement une grande variété de moyens de subsistance. Toutefois, le changement climatique réduira fortement la capacité de ces zones à soutenir certains dentre eux, notamment la pêche et les moyens de subsistance connexes. Ces impacts affecteront de manière négative les moyens de subsistance et les systèmes socio-économiques associés aux ressources littorales. Il est impératif de surveiller et datténuer les impacts du changement climatique sur les forêts humides,  les forêts claires/savanes et les zones humides littorales afin dassurer la durabilité de leurs systèmes socio-économiques et des moyens de subsistance qui y sont associés.
La vulnerabilidad climática de los sistemas socioeconómicos en diferentes tipos de bosques y humedales costeros de África: una síntesis
R.A. KITULA, M. LARWANOU, P.K.T. MUNISHI, J. I. MUOGHALU y L. POPOOLA
Los bosques, terrenos forestales y humedales costeros de África poseen importantes funciones ecológicas y proporcionan bienes y servicios que contribuyen de manera significativa a los medios de vida a escala local, nacional y mundial. Sin embargo, estos ecosistemas son vulnerables a los impactos del cambio climático que afectan a la capacidad de los ecosistemas para ofrecer bienes y servicios. Algunos impactos tendrán efectos positivos y pueden ser entendidos como oportunidades, mientras que otros  tendrán efectos negativos severos que requieren medidas de mitigación adecuadas con las que reducir el impacto sobre los sistemas socioeconómicos. Este artículo revisa información sobre la vulnerabilidad climática de los sistemas socioeconómicos de los bosques húmedos, los terrenos forestales y sabanas y los humedales costeros de África, con el fin de identificar los posibles impactos del cambio climático en los medios de vida.
El cambio climático va a tener un profundo impacto en los bosques húmedos de África, en particular en la reducción de la capacidad de los bosques de suministrar los bienes y servicios ecosistémicos que contribuyen a los medios de vida y los sistemas socioeconómicos asociados. El potencial de captación de agua de los bosques húmedos se verá afectado y deteriorará los medios de vida asociados a los recursos hídricos. Los impactos en los terrenos forestales y sabanas socavarán los recursos disponibles del bosque para el bienestar humano, como la leña, los alimentos y otros productos necesarios para la salud humana. En general, el cambio climático tendrá un impacto negativo en el bosque y en los ecosistemas de terrenos forestales y sabanas, lo que resultará en un efecto directo o indirecto sobre los servicios que prestan los ecosistemas y sobre los medios de vida asociados a ellos. Pero el clima tendrá también un impacto en la agricultura, que conducirá a una producción baja y a un aumento de la dependencia de los bosques que conllevará la degradación o la expansión de la agricultura hacia los bosques para compensar la baja producción, y por lo tanto más deforestación y degradación y más emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero (GEI).
Entre los principales impactos del cambio climático en los humedales costeros se encuentra la reducción de los niveles hídricos y entre los peores escenarios está la desaparición de algunos humedales. Puesto que los humedales costeros albergan una amplia gama de actividades de medios de vida como la pesca y una multitud de medios de vida asociados a ella, el cambio climático socavará en gran medida la capacidad de los humedales costeros para mantener la pesca y los medios de vida relacionados. Dichos impactos afectarán negativamente a los medios de vida y los sistemas socio-económicos asociados a los recursos costeros. El monitoreo y la mitigación de los impactos del cambio climático en los bosques húmedos, los terrenos forestales y sabanas y los humedales costeros es imprescindible para el mantenimiento de los sistemas socioeconómicos y los medios de vida relacionados con ellos.","Kitula, R.

12585,Climate vulnerability of biophysical systems in different forest types and coastal wetlands in Africa: a synthesis.  In International Forestry Review Vol.17 (S3),"Summary
This article synthesizes information on climate vulnerability of biophysical systems in forests, woodlands and coastal wetlands of Africa. Current knowledge indicates that forests and woodlands are sensitive to changes in precipitation, temperature and droughts and are already experiencing dramatic shift in species distribution. They are also undergoing changes in composition, structure and recovery potential due to increased anthropogenic activities exacerbated by climate change. Sea level rise is the greatest climate change challenge that coastal wetlands will face. It can affect coastal wetlands through alteration of inundation period, erosion and salt water intrusion. However, outcomes of interacting factors like temperature increase, variability in precipitation, extreme weather events and carbon dioxide concentration in forests and woodlands are uncertain. Research and models on climate vulnerability in different forest types should be done to improve understanding of climate vulnerability of biophysical systems, adaptation and mitigation potentials thereby guaranteeing achievements of Millennium Development Goals.

Vulnérabilité climatique des systèmes biophysiques dans différents types de forêts et dans les terres humides côtières en Afrique : une synthèse
R.A. KITULA, M. LARWANOU, P.T.K. MUNISHI, J.I. MUOGHALU et L. POPOOLA
Cet article offre une synthèse sur la vulnérabilité climatique des systèmes biophysiques dans les forêts, les terres boisées et les terres côtières humides dAfrique. La connaissance actuelle indique que les forêts et les terres boisées sont sensibles aux changements de précipitations, de température et à la sècheresse, et sont déjà témoins de changements dramatiques dans la distribution des espèces. Elles subissent également des changements dans leur composition, leur structure et leur potentiel de rétablissement, dus aux activités anthropogéniques accrues, exacerbés par le changement climatique. Lélévation du niveau des mers est le changement climatique le plus important auquel les terres côtières humides vont devoir faire face. Elle peut affecter ces dernières à travers des périodes daltération et dinondation, lérosion et lintrusion deau salée. Cependant, les résultats ultimes des facteurs en interaction comme laugmentation de la température, la variabilité des précipitations, les  épisodes météorologiques extrêmes et la concentration de gaz carbonique dans les forêts et les terres boisées demeurent incertains. Une recherche devrait être entreprise et des modèles de vulnérabilité climatique dressés pour différents types de forêts, en vue daméliorer la compréhension de la vulnérabilité climatique des systèmes biophysiques, et de leurs potentiels dadaptation et datténuation, afin de garantir la réussite des Objectifs du millenaire pour le developpement.

Este artículo sintetiza información sobre la vulnerabilidad climática de los sistemas biofísicos en los bosques, terrenos forestales y humedales costeros de África. El conocimiento actual indica que los bosques y los terrenos forestales son sensibles a los cambios en la precipitación, la temperatura y los períodos de sequía y que ya están experimentando cambios dramáticos en la distribución de las especies. También están experimentando cambios en la composición, la estructura y el potencial de recuperación debido a un aumento en las actividades antropogénicas exacerbado por el cambio climático. El aumento del nivel del mar es el mayor desafío del cambio climático al que se enfrentarán los humedalescosteros. Estos se pueden ver afectados debido a la alteración del período de inundación, la erosión y la intrusión de agua salada. Sin embargo, los efectos de la interacción de factores tales como el aumento de la temperatura, la variabilidad de las precipitaciones, los fenómenos meteorológicos extremos y la concentración de dióxido de carbono en los bosques y terrenos forestales son inciertos. Se debería hacer investigación y desarrollar modelos sobre la vulnerabilidad climática en diferentes tipos de bosque para mejorar la comprensión de la vulnerabilidad climática de los sistemas biofísicos, y los potenciales de adaptación y de mitigación, para garantizar con ello el logro de los Objetivos de Desarrollo del Milenio.","Kitula, R.

12586,A brief overview of the capacities of public forest administrations in climate change work in the moist forests countries of Sub-Saharan Africa.  In International Forestry Review Vol.17 (S3),"Summary
The work of Public Forest Administrations (PFAs) has evolved from forest management, to sustainable forest management, to management of forests and woodlands for ecosystem goods and services, and ultimately to climate change adaptation and mitigation. The objective of this review is to give an overview of the capacities of PFAs in forest-related climate work. Findings have shown that though they still exist under national governments like in the colonial era, in the majority of moist forest countries PFAs have been transformed from implementing mere forest protection and conservation into modern people-centred and participatory approaches. Several factors have contributed to this transformation, chief among them being that nowadays the forestry sector embraces sustainable development which emphasizes a shift towards sustainable resource use rather than old age conservation. Most important though, PFAs are not only mandated to carry out conventional forestry but also forest-related climate change work in response to new and emerging environmental challenges. However, PFAs lack physical, human and financial capacities to implement their work due to being under-funded because they are not a top priority in national budgets regardless of the paradigm shift. Furthermore, there is lack of stakeholder participation, unclear access and equitable benefit sharing, inadequate capacity in estimation and reporting on National Green House Gases (GHG) inventories, in application of the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Good Practice Guidance (GPG).

Brève vue densemble des capacités des administrations des forêts publiques dans les travaux liés au changement climatique dans les pays à forêts humides de lAfrique sub-saharienne
C. DLAMINI, M. Larwanou et P.W.CHIRWA
Le travail des Administrations des forêts publiques (PFAs) a évolué de gestion forestière en gestion forestière durable, puis en gestion des forêts et des terres forestières pour les services et les produits de lécosystème et enfin en atténuation du changement climatique et à une adaptation à ce dernier. Lobjectif de cette étude et doffrir une vue densemble des capacités des PFAs dans les travaux liés au changement climatique. Les résultats montrent que, bien que les PFAs existent encore sous une protection nationale comme du temps de lère coloniale, la majorité des pays à forêts humides les ont vu se transformer, passant de la simple mise en exécution dune protection et dune conservation forestière à des approches participatives centrées sur le facteur humain. Plusieurs facteurs ont contribués à cette évolution, le principal étant le fait que le secteur forestier actuel inclut un développement durable qui souligne un mouvement vers une utilisation des ressource durable plutôt quune conservation »à lancienne ». Plus important encore est le fait que les PFAs ne sont pas seulement chargées de soccuper de la foresterie traditionnelle, mais aussi du travail lié au changement climatique au niveau forestier, en réponse à de nouveaux et à démergeants défis environnementaux. Cependant, les PFAs manquent de capacités physiques, humaines et financières pour mettre leur travail en exécution, et ce, dû à un manque de fonds, car ils ne sont pas une priorité importante dans les budgets nationaux, en dépit du changement de vision. De plus, on observe un manque dans la participation des parties prenantes, un accès et un partage équitable des bénéfices vague, une capacité inadéquate destimer et de faire des rapports sur les inventaires des gaz de leffet-serre ( GHG), et une carence dapplication du Guide de bonne pratique (GPG) du Panel inter-gouvernemental sur le changement climatique (IPCC).

El trabajo de las Administraciones Forestales Públicas (AFP) ha evolucionado desde la ordenación forestal, a la ordenación forestal sostenible, a la gestión de los bosques y terrenos forestales para bienes y servicios de los ecosistemas, a la mitigación y la adaptación al cambio climático. El objetivo de esta revisión es dar una visión general de las capacidades de las AFP en las labores sobre el clima relacionadas con los bosques. Los resultados muestran que, a pesar de su existencia dependientes de los gobiernos nacionales al igual que en la época colonial, en la mayoría de los países con bosque húmedo las AFP han cambiado de la mera implementación de la protección y conservación de los bosques hacia planteamientos modernos y participativos centrados en las personas. Son varios los factores que han contribuido a esta transformación, siendo el principal de ellos que hoy en día el sector forestal se acoge a un desarrollo sostenible que hace hincapié en un cambio hacia el uso sostenible de los recursos, en lugar del paradigma de la conservación de antaño. Lo más importante, sin embargo, es que las AFP no sólo tienen el mandato de realizar labores de silvicultura convencionales, sino también otras labores referentes al cambio climático en relación con los bosques,
en respuesta a desafíos ambientales nuevos y emergentes. Sin embargo, las AFP carecen de las capacidades físicas, humanas y financieras para hacer su trabajo debido a no tener suficiente financiamiento, ya que a pesar del cambio paradigmático no son prioritarias en los presupuestos nacionales. Además, en la aplicación de la Guía de Buenas Prácticas (GPG, por sus siglas en inglés) del Grupo Intergubernamental de Expertos sobre el Cambio Climático (IPCC), se observa una falta de participación de las partes interesadas, el acceso a los beneficios no es claro y no hay una distribución equitativa de los mismos, y la capacidad para la estimación y la presentación de informes nacionales sobre de Gases de Efecto Invernadero (GEI) es insuficiente.","Dlamini, C., Larwanou, M. & Chirwa, P.W.",2015,Journal Article,,8/23/2022 9:34,https://afforum.org/oldaff/sites/default/files/English/English_57.pdf,
12587,A review of capacities of public forest administrations for interventions in climate change activities in the dry forest and woodland countries of Sub-Sahara Africa. In International Forestry Review Vol.17 (S3),"Summary
Public Forest Administrations (PFAs) have been transformed from the policing type agencies for forest protection and conservation into modern people-centred institutions applying participatory approaches of forest management. This paper presents an overview of the status of capacity of PFAs and their scope of activities on climate change including stakeholder involvement, access and equitable benefit sharing. Findings indicate that there is a critical shortage of trained personnel to handle the new mandates in order to respond effectively to climate change. Furthermore, PFAs are under-funded and, despite recent shifts in their mandate and scope, they are not prioritized highly in national budgets. In addition, lack of sustainable financing for climate change activities from local and national sources has resulted in most of the funding for forest related climate change activities being funded by external agencies. Consequently, national government PFAs budget increases are imperative. Furthermore, there is an urgent need for local, national and regional initiatives on training and capacity building for PFAs and countries need to elevate the national profiles of their PFAs to be commensurate with the crucial roles forests play in national development.

Las Administraciones Forestales Públicas (AFP) han pasado de ser agencias forestales de tipo policial, con miras a la protección y la conservación, a ser instituciones modernas centradas en las personas, que aplican enfoques participativos de ordenación forestal. Este artículopresenta una visión general del estado de la capacidad de las AFP y el alcance de sus actividades en relación con el cambio climático, como la participación, el acceso y la distribución equitativa de beneficios para las partes interesadas. Los resultados indican que hay una grave escasez de personal capacitado para gestionar los nuevos mandatos con los que dar respuesta de manera efectiva al cambio climático. Por otra parte, las AFP carecen de financiamiento y, a pesar de los cambios recientes en su mandato y su alcance, apenas se priorizan en los presupuestos nacionales. Además, la falta de financiación sostenible para las actividades relacionadas con el cambio climático a partir de fuentes locales y nacionales ha hecho que la mayoría de la financiación de las actividades referentes al cambio climático relacionadas con los bosques estén siendo financiadas por agencias externas. En consecuencia, es imprescindible que los gobiernos nacionales aumenten el presupuesto de las AFP. Asimismo, existe una necesidad urgente de iniciativas locales, nacionales y regionales en materia de formación y desarrollo de capacidades para las AFP y los países deben elevar los perfiles nacionales de sus AFP para que estén en consonancia con las funciones cruciales que
desempeñan los bosques en el desarrollo nacional.","Dlamini, C., Larwanou, M. & Chirwa, P.W.",2015,Journal Article,20372,8/23/2022 13:34,https://afforum.org/oldaff/sites/default/files/English/English_95.pdf,
12588,Management and restoration practices in degraded landscapes of Southern Africa and requirements for up-scaling.  In International Forestry Review Vol.17 (S3),"Summary
Southern African woodlands support the livelihoods of millions of both the rural and urban dwellers through the provision of non-wood products including supply of energy and agricultural expansion thereby contributing to deforestation and woodland degradation. However, there are recognized traditional forest management practices and technologies that have potential to promote rehabilitation and/or restoration of degraded woodlands provided relevant policies and institutional frameworks are in place. This paper reviews the causal factors of land and forest woodland degradation in southern Africa and highlights some of the successful practices for their restoration. Natural regeneration of different forms, including complete coppice; coppice with standards and selective cutting; pollarding, pruning and lopping, was found to be the predominant form of restoration in dry forests and woodlands of southern Africa. However, while policies promoting participatory natural resource management are in place in most countries of the region, implementation of these have mostly taken pilot project based approach with no strategies for up scaling by the governments. In addition, enabling policies for community based approach including clear cut land tenure and equitable benefit sharing are still not operational in most countries of the region. The conditions for up-scaling successful restoration practices include: (i) recognition of local knowledge; (ii) institutional support for implementation of restoration activities; (iii) income generating initiatives through marketing and value adding of natural resources; (iv) taking on financial opportunities from CDM mechanism including REDD.

Gestion et pratiques de restauration dans les paysages dégradés du sud de lAfrique et nécessité daccroître leur envergure
P.W. CHIRWA, M. LARWANOU, S. SYAMPUNGANI et F.D. BABALOLA
Les terres boisées du sud de lAfrique soutiennent les revenus de millions dautochtones ruraux et urbains de par leurs produits autres que le bois, tels que lénergie et lexpansion de lagriculture, aggravant la déforestation et la dégradation de la terre forestière. Toutefois, il existe des pratiques de gestion et des technologies traditionnelles reconnues ayant le potentiel de promouvoir la réhabilitation et/ou la restauration des terres forestières dégradées, si les cadres institutionnels et les politiques appropriées sont en place. Cet article examine les facteurs causant la dégradation de la terre et des terres forestières dans le sud de lAfrique et souligne certaines des pratiques à même dassurer leur restauration. Différentes formes de régénération naturelle telles que la coupe en taillis, celle en taillis à standards et coupe sélective, létêtage, lélagage se sont trouvées être la forme prédominante de restauration dans les forêts et les terres forestières sèches du sud de lAfrique. Cependant, bien que des politiques encourageant la gestion participative des ressources naturelles soient en place dans la plupart des pays de la région, la mise en pratique de ces dernières na été principalement effectuée que dans le cadre dune approche basée sur des projets pilotes, sans stratégie daccroissement par les gouvernements. De plus, la facilitation des politiques dune approche à base communautaire incluant une propriété foncière clairement définie et un partage équitable des bénéfices nest toujours pas opérationnelle dans la plupart des pays de la région. Les conditions pour tirer vers le haut de léchelle les pratiques de restauration efficaces incluent : (i) une reconnaissance de la connaissance locale, (ii) un soutien institutionnel de la mise en pratique des activités de restauration, (iii) des initiatives créatrices de revenus, avec laide du marketing et de la valeur ajoutée aux ressource naturelles, et, (iv) une prise en compte des opportunités financières du mécanisme CDM, incluant la REDD.","Chirwa, P.W., Larwanou, M., Syampungani, S. & Babalola, F.D.",2015,Journal Article,20372,8/22/2022 13:29,https://afforum.org/oldaff/sites/default/files/English/English_96.pdf,
12589,"Sustainable land management practices in the Sahel: review of practices, techniques and technologies for land restoration and strategy for up-scaling.  In International Forestry Review Vol.17 (S3)","Land conversion and degradation in the Sahel have emerged as a primary concern. The process leading to land conversion is sometimes as a consequence of multiple economic, social, cultural and political issues. These have seriously affected the ecological equilibrium, resulting in natural resources degradation, and hence a decline in agricultural production. With serious impact on peoples livelihoods, climate change is also recognized as a major consequence of land conversion and threat in the region. Sustainable Land Management (SLM) is considered as a promising solution to land restoration, mitigation of climate change, and resilience of rural population to external shock. SLM is also considered as a tool for harmonisation of interventions between the major sub-sectors with respect to land use. The paper therefore reviews the various Sustainable Land Management (SLM) practices, techniques and technologies used in the Sahelian countries with focus on their suitability and biophysical benefits. Furthermore, the strategy for up-scaling of the land restoration practices in the Sahelian countries, as well as their requirements and barriers were discussed. Strategies to strengthen the capacities of all stakeholders in SLM approaches, practices, and techniques were recommended.

Pratiques de gestion durable des terres au Sahel : Revue des pratiques, techniques et technologies pour la restauration des terres et de stratégie de mise à échelle
A. MAISHAROU, P.W. CHIRWA, M. LARWANOU, F. BABALOLA et C. OFOEGBU
La conversion et la dégradation des terres sont des préoccupations majeures émergentes au Sahel. Le processus de la conversion des terres est parfois comme une conséquence de questions économiques, sociales, culturelles et politiques multiples. Celles-ci ont sérieusement affecté léquilibre écologique, résultant à une dégradation des ressources naturelles, et donc une baisse de la production agricole. Avec de graves répercussions sur les moyens de subsistance et les conditions de vie des populations, le changement climatique est également reconnu comme une des principales conséquences de la menace et de la conversion des terres dans la région. La Gestion Durable des Terres (GDT) est considéré comme une solution prometteuse à la restauration des terres, à latténuation du changement climatique, et le renforcement de la résilience de la population rurale à des chocs externes. La GDT est également considérée comme un outil pour lharmonisation des interventions entre les principaux sous-secteurs eu égard de lutilisation des terres. Le document examine donc les diverses pratiques, techniques et technologies de Gestion Durable des Terres (GDT) utilisées dans les pays du Sahel avec un accent particulier sur leur pertinence et leurs avantages biophysiques. En outre, la stratégie de mise à léchelle des pratiques de restauration des terres dans les pays du Sahel, ainsi que les besoins et les obstacles ont été discutés.

12590,"Forests and Trees Their roles and opportunities in Africas economic development, food security and environmental health","The purposes of the report are to highlight and promote the great potential roles of forests and trees to contribute to Africas economic development, food security and environmental health and to indicate what requirements need to be addressed in order to realise these potentials. Official statistics on forest and tree resources in Africa are unreliable for many reasons. FAO indicates an area of 675 mill ha of closed forests (23% of the land area), 350 millha of other wooded land, and a considerable and growing volume of wood in trees outside forests, e.g. in agroforestry systems. The plantation area is indicated as c. 15 mill ha, but this includes formations that strictly speaking are not forest plantations. Even more unreliable figures are quoted for uses of wood and NWFPs. First, it must be kept in mind that the estimated use of wood for fire-wood and charcoal accounts for more than 80% (615 mill tons) of wood removals. Wood for industrial purposes is estimated at 72 mill m³ annually, which is probably an underestimate in view of widespread illegal felling/trade in timber. In addition, there is a substantial informal secondary wood and NWF products sector. As a result of all this, the official contribution of the forest sector to GNP and employment is modest, but should, according to FAO, be three times larger if also informal and illegal activities were captured in statistics. Today, many macro-trends and issues influence the forest sector and its potential to contribute to Africas economy, food security and environment. These include: i) a continued high rate of deforestation and forest degradation; ii) a rapid economic development in much of Africa with urbanization and growing middle classes and a growing demand for wood and NWF products; iii) an increasing competition for land for production of food, fibre and fuel (the 3F-question); iv) a rapid growth of tree planting and forest/woodland management by farmers, communities and rural people; and, v) the increasing focus on the role of forests and trees in climate change mitigation.
The potential roles of forests and trees in Africa are treated under three separate categories. The first deals with contributions to economic development and poverty alleviation. The largest wood-based economic sector today is related to production, transport and sale of charcoal, which is estimated to be worth billions of USD and employing millions of people. However, since this almost invariably occurs in the informal, and often illegal, sectors of the economy, figures are uncertain. Demand is rapidly increasing and there is an enormous economic potential provided that charcoal production/sale are legalised, based on sustainably managed forest/tree resources, modernised technology and given advice. The same applies for other products for local and regional markets, such as scaffolding, building and transmission poles, and for locally sawn timber and products like furniture. Due to factors such as increased local demand, export markets and land availability there is also a substantial potential for conventional forest products and commercial level forest and tree management, by private and government enterprises as well as by farmers and communities. The potential contribution of forests and trees to food security is also large, but often overlooked. Already today, the supplementary food and income derived from wood and NWFPs is an essential part of livelihoods of rural people. The potential of trees in increasing/ maintaining fertility of soils and providing fodder to domestic animals, and thereby food crop and livestock productivity and sustainability, have been given much attention in recent decades. The role of forests in hydrology, and thereby water availability for agriculture, and the roles of trees in creating amenable microclimate, e.g. windbreaks and shade also contribute to improved food security. All these various forms of contributions have considerable potentials for improvement. The third category relates to environment enhancement and climate change mitigation. Today, with an almost singular focus on climate change, it is important to point out that by far the most important role forest and tree management can play is to vastly increase the working biomass of wood in sustainably managed forests, plantations and on trees on farm. This is more important than to just focus on halting deforestation. In addition, increased use of wood in long-term deposits, e.g. construction wood, furniture, flooring, etc., will contribute to CO","Lundgren, B.",2015,Book,20387,8/23/2022 8:03,https://afforum.org/oldaff/sites/default/files/English/English_156.pdf,https://afforum.org/oldaff/sites/default/files/French/French_64.pdf

Issues pertaining to South Sudan being the youngest of the eastern African countries are generally covered under Sudan for the time being. With particular reference to climate change, it is a fact that the importance of the need for action is now well recognized in the region, because of the threats climate change carries to all the countries, and their individual and collective vulnerability to its adverse effects.
Countries also recognize their responsibility to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that aggravate climate change and its effects, and the crucial need to implement adaptation measures that will help them cope with its vagaries. This paper addresses two climate change initiatives popularly known as Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs) and National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs), both of which have their origins in decisions taken at the negotiations of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).","Kojwang, H.

12592,"African forests, people and climate change project: forest and climate changes Policies, Strategies and Programmes in the SADC and COMESA regions. Vol 2 (17).","Background
Climate change is now known to be a key threat to achieving sustainable development and poverty reduction targets, as well as attaining the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), in Africa. Climate change is altering rainfall patterns, water availability, and sea levels; it is increasing droughts and the frequency of bushfires, and increasingly impacting on human health, agricultural productivity, forests and biodiversity. In this way, climate change will negatively affect the social, economic and environmental dimensions of human livelihoods in Africa.
While forests are negatively impacted by climate change, forests, in turn, have the potential to play a pivotal role in climate change mitigation and adaptation, and in providing ecosystem services that increase the resilience of rural communities who depend on them. To provide a framework for addressing these issues, the African Forest Forum has initiated a Climate Change Programme that comprises several projects, including the Africa forests, people and climate change project.
Objectives
The main objectives of the present study were to:

Evaluate the implementation challenges and opportunities of policies, strategies and
plans by SADC and COMESA on forestry and climate change;
Assess the role and extent of participation of women, youth and vulnerable groups in forest-based climate change programmes and plans of SADC and COMESA; and
Identify and describe measures, approaches and incentives to increase the role of and benefit to women, youth and vulnerable groups in forest- based climate change programmes and plans of SADC and COMESA.

Methodology
The above objectives were achieved through a literature study that reviewed official documents on policies, strategies and plans of COMESA and SADC. Secondly, primary data were collected through an empirical study that involved face to face interviews with relevant SADC and COMESA officials. For the data collection a trip to SADC in Gaborone, Botswana and another to COMESA in Lusaka, Zambia were undertaken, spending three days in each country. Furthermore, data for objectives 2 and 3 were collected through a questionnaire emailed to all COMESA and SADC member states. The qualitative data were analyzed by synthesis of documents and responses were presented into three sections according to specific objectives.
Findings
The COMESA Climate Initiative of 2008 has made marked progress in the following areas: political commitment, Africa Climate Change Solution, an Africa position on climate change, search for scientific evidence on climate change, partnership with AMCEN, advocacy and mobilization, special focus on CSOs, support to Climate Smart Agriculture, CA Study tours, support to women in up-scaling Climate Smart Agriculture, COMESA Carbon Fund, Forest Strategy, promotion of renewable energy, and support beyond COMESA. On the Forestry Strategy, which was approved in 2009, an action plan to implement the strategy was developed for the period of 2010 to 2012, but things have not gone according to plan; as a result, little has been achieved. Bottlenecks include poor technical capacity and lack of financial resources for implementation. As a result, there is no functional coordinating mechanism for the COMESA Forestry Strategy yet. The SADC secretariat launched the SADC Forest Protocol in 2002, and subsequently a
SADC Forestry Strategy (2010-2020) which captures a reasonable number of Articles in the protocol. Significant progress has been made in strategy implementation, so far, including the following programmes:

A SADC Support Programme on REDD+ (Approved, 2010);
A SADC Regional Fire Management Programme (Approved, 2010, no regional project yet);
FLEGT (still under development, yet to go for approval);
TFC (under development, no regional projects yet);and
regional Project on forests and carbon monitoring systems (based at the SADC Secretariat-4 Pilot countries-Malawi, Zambia, Botswana and Mozambique).

A monitoring tool for national level programmes has been designed and circulated to member states, though responses are not forthcoming, probably due to lack of capacity and funding for research.
Conclusions
Comprehensive policies, strategies, action plans, programmes and projects have been initiated by the SADC and COMESA Secretariats. Corresponding national programmes and projects are already underway in some member states. However the following conclusions can be drawn:
There are numerous challenges to implementation of forest and climate change policies and programmes in the SADC and COMESA regions; there is a lack of emphasis on integration for decision making towards the common goals of sustainable forest management, climate change mitigation and adaptation for
sustainable livelihoods; there are contradictions and conflicts, as well as incompatibilities and unrealised synergies between national forest and climate change related policies and programmes in the SADC and COMESA regions;

there is a lack of adequate and effective integrated national institutional frameworks for policy and strategy implementation in the member states;
implementation is mainly sectoral rather than multi-sectoral or multidisciplinary. Poor technical capacities to direct policy and programme implementation have slowed down progress;
stakeholders lack capacity to effectively participate in forest and climate change programmes;
involvement of women, youth and vulnerable groups in forest-based climate change programmes and projects at local, national and regional levels remains a major challenge in the region, and
lack of sustained financing for the effective implementation of forest and climate change policies, strategies and programmes is a major constraint.

Furthermore, collaboration and regional integration in forest and climate change programmes are still at their infancy and this has resulted in poor exchange programmes in terms of expertise. There is a gap between the SADC and COMESA Secretariats yet they are implementing similar regional programmes. But the COMESA-SADC-EAC Tripartite is expected to drastically improve the situation. In addition there is a tendency for member states to invest more resources and time in the implementation of national policies as compared to SADC and COMESA regional forest and climate change policies and programmes.
Key recommendations
Seeing that there are multiple implementation challenges in SADC and COMESA forest and climate change programmes, AFF at the strategy level may assist SADC and COMESA Secretariats through the following strategic actions:

Providing assistance on innovative ways for involving stakeholders in all the stages of development and implementation of forest and climate change programmes.
Designing suitable programmes and projects that would enhance the capacity of forestry and climate change stakeholders in participating in the relevant forest based climate change programmes.
Contributing to guide policy and programme reviews, analysis, harmonization and alignment. This would enhance the strategic planning processes, so as to enable national forest and climate change focal points to integrate regional programmes in national priorities. Ultimately, this would bridge the gap that currently exists between the SADC and COMESA Secretariats in terms of collaboration at the strategy level.
Helping to develop, solicit funding for, and implement specific programmes and projects geared towards improvement of national and regional institutional frameworks. Furthermore, AFF may advise SADC and COMESA Secretariats on contemporary and innovative sustainable financing mechanisms for successful national and regional forest and climate change programmes.
Facilitating seminars, workshops and conferences where strategic partners and alliances meet to share development lessons on forest and climate change issues, in order to strengthen capacity building and skills development, as well as learning, knowledge generation and information management among stakeholders.
Providing guidelines for promoting gender mainstreaming and youth participation in forest-based climate change programmes. Direct use of the existing AFF Gender Policy should facilitate this process.","Dlamini, C.

12593,"Forest and climate change policies, strategies and programmes in the EAC and IGAD sub-regions. Working Paper Vol. 2 (18).","This report was commissioned as part of a larger study by the African Forest Forum (AFF), to review regional plans and programmes related to people, forests and climate change by partner states of the East African Community (EAC) and the Inter-governmental Authority on Development (IGAD). EAC and IGAD are both sub-regional institutions with differences emanating from the laws that established them. EAC was established under a treaty while IGAD was established by an agreement. These different methods of establishment seem to have a bearing on the way the two institutions operate/function, as reflected by the differences in what the secretariats to EAC and IGAD are doing regarding climate change.
EAC has achieved more progress compared to IGAD in implementing climate change programmes. For example, EAC has developed and enacted climate change policy instruments to guide and coordinate implementation of programmes in partner states while IGAD has not. Also, the number of climate change and related programmes on environment and natural resources management and conservation policy instruments, and approved CDM and CDM application projects are more in EAC than in IGAD member states, except for Kenya and Uganda whose memberships overlap in the two Regional Economic Communities (RECs).
Main findings
All the EAC and IGAD member states have signed and ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol on climate change and, as a requirement, do submit NAPA and NAMA reports. However, only the EAC has developed a climate change policy, a strategy and a plan, proposed the creation of a Climate Change Fund, and entered into a regional collaboration on climate change with COMESA. At the national level, only Kenya has developed a climate change strategy established a Climate Change Coordination Unit (CCCU) and proposed the establishment of a National Climate Change Fund. By contrast, IGAD has not developed any climate change policy, strategy or plan. Instead, IGAD has developed disaster risk assessment and preparedness policies and also established drought and famine early warning institutions (i.e., ICPAC, AMESD, EWARN, etc.); that are also furnishing climate change risk prediction data. As such, this report recommends that IGAD also, needs to develop a sub-regional climate change policy through which it will guide and coordinate its member states in the implementation of climate change programmes.
Although EAC has achieved some success in developing climate change instruments, actual implementation lies with the partner states. Perhaps, one challenge faced by the EAC sub-region, regarding the climate change policy instruments it has developed, is how to translate their good intentions into sustainable and effective actions; and how resource investments for implementation of the programmes can be secured in order to reduce longterm vulnerability. Underlying climate change risks and closely coupled with lack of implementation resources, is the lack and/or inadequate capacity (knowledge, skills, competencies, personnel and at different levels) to mainstream climate change into national development programmes at national and community levels. Capacity-building is a very important area that this report strongly recommends for strengthening by both EAC and IGAD (once they have developed climate change policy instruments). Inadequate, or lack, of resources to finance climate change programmes is a key constraint. National governments confronted with other immediate priorities (e.g., &gt;40% youth unemployment rate, &gt;50% poverty levels, food insecurity, etc.), are able to only allocate limited funds to climate change due to its perceived low priority. In order to address this shortcoming, it is recommended that climate change be adequately and effectively integrated into all development programmes as it is, in any case, a cross-cutting issue.
Key climate change needs
Gender and youth mainstreaming into climate change risk reduction and management
Women, children and vulnerable groups are the worst affected by climate change disasters. But since gender is a social construct, more often than not, women are left out in discussions/decisions that most affect them. As a result, strategies and plans developed are often gender-blind. Since 50% of any population is comprised of women and &gt;65% is madeup of young people under 15 years of age; it is very important that gender and youth considerations be mainstreamed - including participation - into all climate change programme stages (planning, implementation, review, etc.).
Increased financial support for climate change risk reduction initiatives
The EAC-CCMP (2011-2031) presents a budget for supporting the implementation of identified climate change activities. But this is not sufficient, considering more needs to be done according to the identified implementation gaps by the present report. As such, an EAC Climate Change Fund has also been proposed. Countries, on their part, are struggling financially, as far as climate change is concerned. Poverty and the argument that their small or even negative contributions to GHG emission, make them misguidedly reluctant to allocate their limited national resources to climate change programmes. As such, financing implementation of climate change activity is left at the mercy of available global (UNFCCC, Kyoto Protocol, etc.) financing mechanisms. Despite this, compared to countries like China, Brazil, India, South Africa and Indonesia, EAC and IGAD member states have performed poorly in accessing available resources from global climate change mechanisms to implement CDM projects. This report therefore recommends that special attention/assistance be given to address this area (accessing global climate change funds), in order to move climate change risk management and avoidance in the sub-region forward. Considering their areas of comparative advantage, it is recommended that AFF develops a climate change framework, to inform national governments on how to increase access to financial support for risk reduction initiatives.
Mainstreaming climate change risk reduction into development planning
Climate change affects all government functions at the macro-level (through all ministries and departments) and at the micro-level (through effects on communities), although not equally. Focal ministries responsible for climate change, through CCCUs, should make it their responsibility to mainstream climate change into all other development and nondevelopment programmes; with special emphasis attached to community-level implementation and gender. Of special interest is the prominent role of forestry  especially tree planting under agroforestry systems. Yet, the link between climate change and an increase of tree area seems to be assumed, rather than being clearly explained and promoted. The same is true of farmer managed natural regeneration. Other than promoting trees for trees sake, AFF should develop a deliberate approach that links and/or integrates tree production into day-to-day community resilience and climate change risk reduction, risk avoidance and increased resilience.
Improved identification, assessment, and awareness of climate change risks
Droughts resulting in famine, floods, landslides and climate related epidemics are a common occurrence risk faced by inhabitants of EAC and IGAD. Vulnerability of inhabitants to these disaster risks is responsible for high levels of poverty in the region. Although collaborations between national institutions (like meteorological stations) and sub-regional institutions (like ICPAC) exist, coordination between and among them is at best very poor and at worst non-existent. Therefore, there is not only need to strengthen knowledge and understanding of geographical distribution, type and extent of climate change disaster risk and vulnerability, but also an urgent need for effective coordination and exchange of knowledge and information. Profiling of climate change risk and potential impacts to development, at both national and community levels should also be intensified.
Developing climate change programme management and coordination capacity
Inadequate capacity, and in some cases complete absence of climate change technicians/professionals, is a major problem in the effective domestication and implementation of developed policies, strategies and plans. In this regard there is an urgent need to introduce climate change as a subject of study at all institutions of learning. An approach that presents climate change as a cross-cutting issue should be adopted in capacity training. A serious problem facing member states of EAC and IGAD is the proliferation of institutions with climate change agenda, but currently without coordination mechanisms for information distribution or even how to assess impacts of human capacity enhancement programmes.
Enhanced knowledge management for climate change risk reduction
Effective climate change risk management can only take place when knowledge on disaster risk reduction options is adequately disseminated. There is need therefore to strengthen regional, national and local mechanisms for knowledge sharing; through all available methods (i.e., radio, newspaper, theatre, traditional folklore and story-telling, etc.). The aim should be to share experiences and information, identify needs and encourage closer collaboration.
Increased public awareness for climate change risk reduction
Institutions responsible for climate related risk assessment exist in EAC (e.g., National Meteorological Stations), and IGAD (e.g.., ICPAC, AMESD, EWARN). But these are little known by the general public, let alone many central government ministries and departments. To be aware is an important component of empowerment. All available means should therefore be used in making institutions (private and public) and individuals aware of the risks posed by climate change, as well as management and avoidance options available to them.
Facilitating the strengthening of climate change risk reduction institutions
Mandate for climate change in all the countries is scattered in many government ministries, except for Kenya which has established a CCCU. Coordination of climate change activities of these institutions is not only weak but also ineffective. Competition and rivalry for scarce resources is also a serious problem. All countries should therefore formulate climate change policies, strategies and plans; and establish CCCUs to coordinate climate change activities. For this to happen, it is necessary for countries to raise more resources (financial and human) for this purpose.
Integrating climate change risk reduction into disaster response management
States have not developed climate change policies, strategies and plans; except for Kenya. Current handling of climate change activities is uncoordinated and has an add-on rather than an integrated approach. EAC and IGAD member states should integrate climate change response actions into disaster response management.","Milimo, P.B.",2014,Working Paper,20399,4/3/2015 10:11,https://afforum.org/oldaff/sites/default/files/English/English_90.pdf,https://afforum.org/oldaff/sites/default/files/French/French_55.pdf
12594,"Climate change vulnerability of African forest plantations and the role of permanent sample plots in monitoring, reporting and verification for REDD+ in plantations. Vol 2 (4).","Given the potential impacts of climate change on the commercial forestry sector, and the fact that such impacts can already be detected in Africa, the development and implementation of adaptation policies, measures and strategies are crucial. Although there is still uncertainty surrounding the magnitude and timing of climate change in the future, the negative impacts of this change are likely to be enormous. Thus, adaptation needs to occur in the immediate future. Processes need to be implemented now, as the time scales for these processes to take effect and be adopted are likely to be long in the case of plantation forestry. In implementing adaptation measures, a no regrets approach ought to take priority. The measures implemented under a no regrets approach will have benefits which are equal to or exceed their cost to society, and will be of benefit regardless of climate change. Other adaptive interventions will include:

a change in forestry practices to using and developing more heat and drought resistant species and hybrids; the use of native species ought to be encouraged since exotic species tend to negatively influence biodiversity; however, this should be balanced against aspects of productivity and brevity of rotation age, and thereby the undisputed economic advantage of plantations, which are main factors associated with the introduction of exotics;
mixing species, to provide insurance against some impacts of climate change, with plantation forestry moving towards mixed cultures rather than the currently dominant monocultures;
better matching of species to their optimal ecological range, that is, if the site is currently at the dry end of the species range, that species should no longer be planted there;
giving consideration to climate change predictions when planning the future of African countries plantation forestry in terms of species and provenance selection, tending, management regimes, production, consumption and trade of forest products;
the use of water harvesting methods to relieve water stress during the establishment stage in order to give seedlings and saplings a good start via irrigation. This intervention can be supplemented with the use of fertilizers and boosters in the early stages of the plantation establishment.

The study and assessment of the extent of vulnerability of African forest and tree plantations to climate change and monitoring the effectiveness of any mitigation and/or adaptation intervention requires a scientific method consistent with how plantations have been established and managed in the past. Such a method requires the use of a sampling framework that can produce the information necessary to feed the policy/management process. For as long as forest plantations have been established, management has deployed the use of permanent sample plots (PSPs) as a key part of a monitoring framework.
A temporary sample plot provides a snapshot of the attribute of interest, while a permanent sample plot allows for re-measurement over time that provides a dynamic picture of the attribute. Management of forest plantations in Africa has only put in place a few permanent sample plots to provide data for growth modelling, planning silvicultural interventions and harvesting cycles. A review in South African and Kenyan plantations found that the existing PSPs are inadequate even for plantation management purposes, mostly due to resource constraints. It is estimated that there exists less than 40% of the required number of PSPs in various states of management and monitoring.
In the wake of mitigation programmes like Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+), permanent sample plots will be required to provide the necessary data for carbon accounting. Introduction of REDD+ in plantations in Africa will require a significant expansion of the number and location of the PSPs in order to obtain estimates of the carbon-relevant plantation attributes including below- and aboveground carbon density, detritus, products and decomposition profiles. Using a Kenyan study as a benchmark, it was estimated that in order to allow African plantations to fully participate in the REDD+ program, it will require at least 3000 PSPs to provide adequate data for aboveground biomass carbon stock for wall-to-wall monitoring, reporting and verification. It is recommended that each country with forest plantations establish a biometric department at the plantation management level that will be charged with the responsibility to establish an adequate number of PSPs, and to collect and transmit data to a central repository from which REDD+ stakeholders can have seamless access. A region or continent-wide network of these data centres and practitioners will reduce costs by cross sectional sharing of pertinent data.","Makundi, W.R.",2014,Working Paper,20403,3/3/2015 14:58,https://afforum.org/oldaff/sites/default/files/English/English_77.pdf,https://afforum.org/oldaff/sites/default/files/French/French_41.pdf

12596,Climate change and African moist forests. Policy Brief Vol. 2 (3),"African moist forests are enduring ever more pressure from over-use and climate change. Interest is increasing in their contribution to global mitigation and adaptation strategies. The challenge now is how to reduce deforestation without threatening the livelihoods of millions of people who depend on African moist forests. Policy changes are required to transform internationally binding agreements into effective national laws. More monitoring of moist forests and comprehensive data analysis are urgently needed. But above all, local coping strategies must be assessed, and adapted and expanded where they are shown to support livelihoods while also protecting the forests on which they depend.","Okali, D.",2012,Policy Brief,20411,8/24/2022 11:43,https://afforum.org/oldaff/sites/default/files/English/English_75.pdf,https://afforum.org/oldaff/sites/default/files/French/French_50.pdf
12597,Cross-border trade in forest products and services and trade impacts in West Africa. Working Paper Vol 2 (8).,"Forestry and rural development are on the cusp of major changes in West Africa with Forest Law Enforcement and Trade (FLEGT) measures already affecting the international timber trade, with knock-on effects for wider patterns of forest exploitation. New opportunities for carbon conservation and bio-energy and new streams of carbon finance may greatly enhance the value of land, with significant impacts on the natural landscape and the place of forests within it. At the same time, the drivers of deforestation and degradation, many of which lie outside the forest sector, are intensifying in their effects, under the hydra-headed pressures of population growth, urbanisation, unemployment and political conflicts as well as consequent anthropogenic activities in and around the forests in the West African sub-region.
In the majority of countries with considerable potential for REDD, illegal activities (extraction of timber and NTFPs) have been significant drivers of deforestation. These call for careful examination. Although there are forest policies in virtually all countries in the sub-region, their implementation is too weak to address contemporary challenges in the forestry sector. Also, the extent to which policies and laws are implemented, the level of understanding of the issues surrounding forest law compliance, the use of emerging and appropriate technologies, and the participation of local communities in monitoring forest law compliance vary among countries in the sub-region; comparing and the sharing of knowledge and experiences, therefore, is of great importance. On the other hand, there are excessive restrictions on legal access of local communities to forest resources. Such restrictions have promoted and encouraged the surreptitious and illegal extraction of forest resources and the encroachment on forest lands in much of the West African sub-region. Illegal logging and trade, both on a large scale, are negatively affecting the profitability and competitiveness of the forest industry, in addition to the predicted impact on global warming.
Timber trade in the West African sub-region is influenced by local, regional and overseas demands, with Europe being an important market for the major producing countries in the region, though increasingly trade among the countries is also becoming manifest. Much of the demands in the local and national markets are now being satisfied with cheap rough-sawn and low-grade timber used in construction and joinery. Trade in timber and non-timber products in the sub-region is characterised by limited availability of statistics and a high volume of trade based on unrecorded or illegal forest product movements. Foreign markets and other important destinations for timber exports from West Africa are Europe, USA, China and India, with buyers from the latter two nations becoming increasingly active in the sub-region. While the European countries and USA are supporting initiatives to eradicate illegal logging, limited concern is being shown by either Indian or Chinese buyers, who are allegedly complicit in some of the illegal trade. Failure to curtail such activity will undermine efforts being made under the FLEGT and other initiatives.
Comparative analysis of the export and customs procedures throughout West Africa shows a strong similarity among systems and the roles of the government forestry and customs authorities. The former is responsible for verification of exports and contract conformity and issuing of certificates of origin, and the latter for final inspection against export and loading statements. However, in many West African countries, implementation demonstrates weaknesses and widespread opportunity to circumvent requirements. The trends show booming local demand for low-grade and low-cost timber and plywood, due mainly to increased demands for housing arising from relatively significant growths in the economies of the sub-region. Not surprisingly, in view of the informal nature of this trade, it has not translated into significant increases in GDP per capita.
The informal sector is important in wood processing across the sub-region, supplying significant quantities of sawn-wood, furniture and joinery to urban, peri-urban and rural markets. Together, these markets are much larger in volume than the exports leaving the formal sector. Generally, with low rates of conversion, the informal sector is a bigger consumer of wood fibre than the formal sector. However, there is potential for broadening opportunities for improved efficiency across the sector. In Ghana, for example, this has contributed significantly to the economy and sometimes adds real value, whereas the formal sector detracts from value. There is thus need for the encouragement of Small and Medium Forest Enterprises (SMFEs) to overcome financial distress and improve efficiency to enable them contribute significantly to employment, poverty reduction and sustainable livelihoods.
Non-timber forest products (NTFPs) are of considerable significance in the economies of the sub-region, and underpin the livelihoods and coping strategies of the poor. However, their use and management is frequently constrained by forestry laws developed to promote conservation and sustainable management of timber species, but inappropriate for the rational management of the resources in question. This underscores the need to move from the old sustained timber yield view of forest management towards a multiple-use approach.
Forest trade and value chain analyses in West Africa should ordinarily be simple; however, such analyses present a complex scenario. The complexity arises from administrative processes to the technical aspects of the trade. Obsolete industry equipment as well as inadequate and unreliable data also makes its application a daunting task. Forest governance remains a huge challenge in most West African countries. Policy and market failures underpin the poor forest governance in the sub-region and are evident in badly functioning and distorted markets with poor and perverse incentives to manage and conserve the resource. The impacts of the scenarios on climate change are far-reaching and need to be frontally addressed. Capacity building and strengthening, commitment to international processes and ordinances are keys to addressing observed institutional and policy weaknesses in the sector.","Popoola, L.",2014,Working Paper,20406,10/12/2014 14:40,https://afforum.org/oldaff/sites/default/files/English/English_88.pdf,https://afforum.org/oldaff/sites/default/files/French/French_53.pdf
12598,Assessment of the status of forestry associations in West Africa. Vol 2 (7).,"Professional associations are needful for effective coordination of professional activities to enable them achieve the aims and objectives of setting the up. Such associations abound for most professions in Europe, America and Asia. They are gradually finding relevance in Africa. The prevalence of professional forestry associations in West Africa was investigated.
The study covered Benin, Cameroon, the Gambia, Ghana, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal and Sierra Leone. Indices examined include mission, governance, effectiveness, efficiency relevance, financial viability, leadership, strategic and programme planning, programme implementation, monitoring and evaluation as well as networking/partnership/linkages. Of the eight countries studied, Benin and the Gambia did not have professional forestry associations.
By far, the most established and active of the six associations examined in the sub-region is the Forestry Association of Nigeria (FAN) founded in October, 1970, followed by Forestry Association of Ghana (FAG) and The National Forestry and Wildlife Association (NFWA) of Sierra Leone. Though all the associations have governance structures, the relative strength of each of them determines their effectiveness, efficiency and financial viability. All the associations are resource-poor and need to be strengthened in terms of administration and funding to enable them accomplish their missions better. An umbrella forestry association is recommended for Africa, with nodes in sub-regions. The African Forest Forum is most suited to facilitate this.","Popoola, L.",2014,Working Paper,20407,10/12/2014 14:35,https://afforum.org/oldaff/sites/default/files/English/English_70.pdf,https://afforum.org/oldaff/sites/default/files/French/French_34.pdf
12599,Climate vulnerability of biophysical and socio-economic systems in woodlands and savannas in Eastern and Southern Africa. Vol. 2 (6).,"Climate change is a major threat to achieving the poverty reduction aspirations of many African countries as well as to the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). It is affecting rainfall patterns, water availability, sea levels, the dynamics of droughts and bushfire frequency. These are increasingly impacting woodland ecosystems, associated livelihoods, human health, agriculture productivity and biodiversity (Munishi et al., 2010; Kowero, 2011). Climate change will therefore adversely affect livelihoods, national incomes and the environment. While woodlands are affected by climate change, they also play key roles in mitigation and adaptation to climate change. These roles may include increasing the resilience of rural communities to climate change and support to species to adapt to changing climate by acting as refuge during adverse climate conditions. Woodlands also indirectly support economies to adapt to climate change by reducing costs of climate-related negative impacts, through provision of goods and services during extreme weather events, and by providing key assets for reducing vulnerability to the effects of climate change. Woodlands play a major role in climate change mitigation as deforestation and forest degradation is estimated to contribute to about 18% of the global carbon dioxide (greenhouse gas - GHG) emissions and have considerable potential to mitigate emissions through carbon sequestration. The major objective of this work was to review available information on climate vulnerability of biophysical (i.e. soil, water, and biological resources) and socio-economic (i.e. human health, livelihoods, products, trade and development) systems in woodlands of Eastern and Southern Africa.
The woodlands of Eastern and Southern Africa are of various types including Miombo Woodlands covering about one-third of the region, Terminalia-Combretum savannah woodlands, Mopane woodland and Zambezi Teak (Baikiaea plurijuga) woodland. Further the Acacia-Combretum woodlands in Zimbabwe and AcaciaCommiphora woodlands in Kenya and Tanzania form major woodland types. The Miombo ecosystem is one of the tropical wildernesses in the world covering about 3.6 million km2 and spanning ten countries in East, Central and Southern Africa (Munishi et al., 2011).
Climate change will have wide-ranging effects on the environment, and on socio-economic and related sectors, including water resources, agriculture and food security, human health, terrestrial ecosystems and biodiversity, woodlands inclusive. The woodlands of Eastern and Southern Africa will be responding to variable rainfall in terms of seasonality and amounts with predominantly decreasing rainfall and increasing temperatures (Munishi et al., 2010). Climate change scenarios for Africa include higher temperatures across the continent estimated to be increasing by 0.2°C per decade (Elagib and Mansell, 2000) and more erratic precipitation. Changes in rainfall patterns are likely to lead to severe water shortages and/or flooding while temperature increases will potentially severely increase rates of extinction for many habitats and species (up to 30 per cent with a 2°C rise in temperature).
Water-related problems, already serious in the region, are likely to worsen as a result of climate change (AMCEN, 2011). Intense rainfall events will increase the incidence of flooding in many areas. At the same time, reduced run-off will exacerbate water stress and reduce the quality and quantity of water available for domestic, crop and livestock use. In a wider context the predicted impacts of climate change on water resources in woodlands of Eastern and Southern Africa indicate that by 2020, between 75 and 250 million people are projected to be exposed to increased water stress. Agricultural production, including access to food, in many Eastern and Southern African countries is projected to be severely compromised due to water scarcity which will further adversely affect food security and exacerbate malnutrition.
The woodlands of Eastern and Southern Africa are diverse and such diverse vegetation would imply a variety of habitats and areas of high species diversity and endemism. Climate change impacts on the woodlands in this region will thus likely impact biodiversity and vulnerable endemic species. Major impacts of climate change on the woodlands include changes within some types and disappearance of others, and changes in species composition. Because climate is a primary determinant of species distributions and ecosystem processes, new climates may promote formation of new species associations and other ecological changes whereas changes in current climates may also increases the risk of extinction of species with narrow geographic or climatic distributions and disruption of existing communities.
Eastern and Southern African woodlands are critical for the well","Munishi, P.K.T.",2014,Working Paper,20408,10/12/2014 12:40,https://afforum.org/oldaff/sites/default/files/English/English_82.pdf,https://afforum.org/oldaff/sites/default/files/French/French_46.pdf
12600,African woodlands and savannahs: opportunities from and potential of REDD+. Vol 2 (15).,"Climate change adversely affects the environment and human livelihoods. This is through alteration of rainfall patterns as well as water availability, sea level and ecosystem productivity, e.g. forest ecosystem. Forest ecosystems are believed to perform a vital role in helping people in developing countries to adapt to negative impacts of climate change since they capture and store carbon dioxide (CO2) apart from provision of other goods and services, typically manifested during extreme events (such as droughts and floods). Forested areas are, therefore, key resources for mitigating and reducing vulnerability to climate change. The global storage of carbon in forest ecosystems is estimated to be more than 650 billion tons of carbon, of which 44% is stored in biomass, 11% in dead wood and litter, and 45% stored in soil. Despite this capacity, about 17.4% of global greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions originate from the forest sector through deforestation and forest degradation.
The United Nations (UN) initiated a program dedicated to Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (UN-REDD) as an effort to create a financial value for the carbon stored in forests growing in developing countries. Mitigation and adaptation of UN-REDD fulfilled the aims of several international climate change conventions, including international commitment under the UNFCCC 2009 Copenhagen Accord and the Cancun Agreement of 2010. There was an evolution of REDD to REDD+ which went further than just deforestation and forest degradation, but included the role of conservation, sustainable forest management, enhancement of forest carbon stocks while upholding the improvement for rural livelihoods in developing countries. In this way, developing countries are encouraged to reduce emissions from forest lands while benefiting from sustainable forest management. This emerged after the realisation that forests are estimated to reduce emissions to values between 13 and 50 billion tons (Gt) of carbon dioxide by 2100 (African Wildlife Foundation, 2011) and can, therefore, become a cornerstone of the post - 2012 global climate change agenda. The establishment and sustainability of REDD+ in African societies requires significant initial investment in the strengthening of local institutions, good governance, capacity building and alternative livelihood opportunities. There is need for continuous support to countries in areas of communication, knowledge sharing and stakeholder engagement to safeguard the accuracy and extensive dissemination of information about REDD+.
Forest ecosystems can be divided by physiognomic types forming eco-regions and these are classified into: Forests (montane and lowland), woodlands and savannahs (East African, Sudanian and Zambezian) and the Sahel.
This report is based on REDD+ activities in African woodlands and savannahs. The African woodland and savannah ecosystems are distributed across 31 countries, i.e. 9 in Southern Africa, 13 in West Africa and 9 in East and Central Africa covering an area greater than 3.8 million km2. The savannah woodlands are divided into moist dystrophic and arid eutrophic depending on species composition and soil nutrient status. The miombo woodland is the dominant woodland type in Southern Africa while the Acacia and open woodland dominate the other parts of Africa.
Only four of the countries have received direct support for national REDD programmes, namely Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Nigeria, Tanzania, and Zambia whilst eleven, (Benin, Cameroon, Chad, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, South Sudan, Sudan, Uganda and Zimbabwe) do not receive direct support but engage with the UN-REDD processes.
Most of the countries implementing REDD+ projects have some small-scale private sector funding for sub-national level projects based on the existing voluntary forest carbon markets. In countries, such as Zimbabwe, private sector investment in project development is the only form of REDD+ activity. Donor or public funding currently flowing into some countries, such as Kenya and Tanzania, have projects that provided valuable models and lessons from the sub-national and project level REDD+ processes. The initial level of investment for REDD+ activities varies significantly depending on community histories, experiences of development projects and forest management activities at both national and sub-national levels. National REDD+ readiness planning activities, in some countries, include activities funded by the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF), forest investment programme (FIP) and private investment programmes. In countries, such as Cameroon and Ghana, there is lack of effective actions to ensure the participation of local people while in other countries they tend to have missed substantial data on the drivers of deforestation. The issue of land tenure has received exaggerated criticism, and some countries have not put in place clear policies/guidelines on carbon rights and benefit sharing mechanisms. In some countries, e.g. Cameroon, studies have shown that current projects lack transparency, meaningful participation or Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) and disregard issues of land tenure, customary rights and benefit sharing.
Successful climate change mitigation and adaptation must improve the welfare of rural people while integrating sustainable forest management and biodiversity protection. Several models for benefit sharing have been identified. In Tanzania, the community carbon enterprise model has been used as a tool for benefit sharing whilst in Kenya, the benefit sharing model is based on one third each for community development, the individual and the project running costs. The community funds are administered through a trust fund mechanism following some procedures that facilitate transparency. Good governance structures, land tenure systems and law enforcement, market and cultural values of forests, the rights of local communities, benefit-sharing mechanisms as well as poverty and food production policies are important considerations for the success of REDD+ initiatives. In addition, REDD+ projects can be successful when issues of transparency and accountability are precisely addressed and forest management and land use planning are integrated. The primary lessons learnt through pilot projects demonstrate some of the challenges that REDD+ presents in Africa but also provide insights for molding REDD+ policy frameworks for the benefits of communities while promoting forest conservation in Africa.
REDD+ pilot projects have demonstrated that climate change mitigation through forest carbon payments can enhance the incomes of the rural poor as well as increasing opportunities for adaptation to climate change and growth. Generally, payments for REDD+ and other ecosystem services have great potential in the light of the diversity of schemes that are likely to emerge and the diversity of services likely to be obtained, including potential positive impact on the environment. REDD+ has the ability to save public and private sector funds by promoting a diversity of benefits, improving peoples livelihoods and having potential to reduce conflict.
The need for simple, rapid monitoring methods cannot be over-emphasised. A number of scientific evidence gaps are linked to the accuracy of carbon accounting, ascribed to a lack of data, and there are uncertainties related to carbon storage and carbon flux models. Though the REDD+ processes require community participation in monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV), engagement of experts for accurate accounting should not be overruled.
In order to avoid inconsistencies, there might be a need for nested schemes, where projects are linked to sub-national projects, which, in turn, are linked to national projects. Discrete projects need to be adequately coordinated by umbrella organizations operating over larger scales in order to promote the longevity of project impacts at the local scale and allow experiences and good practices to feed into national policy development. Capacity building and resource investments across different levels are also shown to be vital.
The following are the key lessons learnt.
It is important to identify and quantify the actual drivers of deforestation and forest degradation before any project is implemented. The scope, goals and functioning of a REDD+ process should be clearly communicated to all stakeholders ensuring that a wide audience is included in raising awareness and capacity building activities. Countries may need assistance for continuous financial and technical support for learning and knowledge-sharing activities. In some countries, REDD+ activities have gone ahead without national REDD+ strategies. This has caused tension between government departments, NGOs and the private sector. It would be important to include all countries in REDD+ preparatory schemes.
There should be clear methodologies to address the identified drivers of deforestation and forest degradation. Countries may need assistance in developing tools for effective stakeholders engagement and capacity building for monitoring deforestation and forest degradation. Most of the REDD+ strategies are financially resource intensive and technically challenging, and need to be supported continually.
As REDD+ initiatives continue, national strategies to address drivers of deforestation and forest degradation need to be integrated with other land use systems and clearly reflected in institutional platforms for synchronisation. There is an urgent need for assistance to all countries to formulate national REDD+ strategies. In addition, there is need for the establishment of more permanent institutional infrastructure that guides and enables dialogue about REDD+ at the national level, including coordination and assessment of complementarities of multiple sources of REDD+ and climate funding to avoid duplication of efforts.
There is a need to manage expectations of communities about revenue from the REDD+ projects/initiatives, including outlining the potential amounts and timing of payments. Increased funding may be required to protect REDD+ projects from inadequately compensated communities so that they do not destroy the forest. In addition, there is need for sensitisation and training of neighbouring communities to ensure that they also reduce or avoid deforestation and forest degradation.
There are several designs to benefit sharing mechanisms, and these provide some clear lessons for other REDD+ projects. Communities are different and, hence, each project should be community specific. There is a need for continuous communication and clear information flow between the communities and other actors, especially safeguards for Social Impact assessment and FPIC at the early stages of project development.
Effective strategies have been built on existing relationships that have expanded into REDD+ projects (social capital) by developing on existing knowledge, experience and relationships that have transparent decision making and based on honesty as well as accountability and are truly participatory.
There are difficulties to secure carbon markets for some developers, and this has created tension from engaged local communities as they need the carbon benefits immediately. There is need for regular updates to engaged local communities on progress and position of carbon markets to contain their expectations.","Mujuru, L. & Chidumayo, E.",2014,Working Paper,20424,10/12/2014 12:38,https://afforum.org/oldaff/sites/default/files/English/English_72.pdf,https://afforum.org/oldaff/sites/default/files/French/French_36.pdf
12601,Prospects for REDD+ in African forest plantations. Working Paper Vol. 2 (5),"This report examined the prospects of greenhouse gas mitigation in African tree Plantations, with a focus on the potential of Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) in Plantations.
Plantations constitute one out of every five hectares of world forests which currently add up to 4 220 million hectares. It is estimated that c. 16 million ha of plantations are growing in Africa, which is about 4% of all African forests, compared to a significantly higher global average of 7%. In recent years there has been an accelerated pace of planting in Africa, especially by the private sector and non-public actors.
Forest plantations are subject to the same factors that drive deforestation and forest degradation in general, albeit to a varying degree. This study reports that, since 1990, Africa has been losing an estimated 51 000 ha of plantations annually with a carbon stock averaging 30 t/ha. A further 200 000 ha are estimated to be in various states of degradation every year.
Interventions to reduce and/or eliminate carbon emissions through establishment of plantations could lead to substantial carbon benefits under the REDD+ programme given the eventual high carbon stocking of fast-growing plantations. Estimates using standard assumptions on carbon stocking in plantations suggest that about 40 million tonnes of CO2 could be creditable to REDD+ annually.
The study further reviewed other mitigation activities possible in African plantations and most of these will fall in the category of Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Activities agreed on in Doha in 2012. Such activities may include biomass conservation, utilisation efficiency improvements, using plantation and wood industry residues for co-generation of heat and power, complimentary possibilities to establish new plantations for the production of biofuels, as long as it does not impinge on food security and exacerbate land conflicts where the resource is scarce. It is also recommended that African countries consider expansion of plantations as a REDD+ programme to relieve pressure on natural forests.
When applied to plantations, REDD+ has less community conflicts over tenure, ownership and access given the largely public ownership of plantations in Africa.
With the extent of plantations, and the significant rates of deforestation and degradation, it is recommended that plantations be opened to all mitigation options available in the forestry sector, especially REDD+. It is thus recommended that African countries involve plantations in climate change baseline studies and include MRV issues in the regular plantation management plans.
To allow for meaningful participation of plantations in GHG mitigation, African countries should foment the policy and institutional changes necessary within the forest management system.","Makundi, R.W.",2014,Working Paper,20417,10/12/2014 12:00,https://afforum.org/oldaff/sites/default/files/English/English_80.pdf,https://afforum.org/oldaff/sites/default/files/French/French_44.pdf
12602,"Scope, potential and implementation of mitigation activities in mangrove forests in eastern and Southern Africa. Working Paper Vol. 2 (1)","Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation, plus the role of conservation, SFM, and forest carbon stock enhancement (REDD+) is a policy initiative developed by the international community to counteract the loss of forests and to provide incentives against deforestation in developing countries. With this new international mandate to tackle deforestation and forest degradation, this report was developed for the African Forest Forum (AFF) African forests, people and climate change project to evaluate the scope, potential and implementation of mitigation activities in mangrove forests in Eastern and Southern Africa. It was considered important to contribute to the understanding of the role of mangrove carbon credits to the livelihood of local communities and to sustain biodiversity and improve the quality of the environment. This also led to recommendations for furthers studies and formulation of REDD+ policies and programmes aiming at increasing equity and enhancing carbon stock in mangrove forests.
The study revealed that REDD+ activities implemented in mangrove forests in Kenya and Tanzania were basically readiness and demonstration. These activities were implemented at all levels and they were not specific to mangrove forests. Various institutional arrangements were established at all levels to provide enabling environments for implementation of REDD+ activities in mangrove forests. Mikoko Pamoja and Hifadhi Misitu ya Asili were the only two active REDD+ pilot projects in mangrove forests in Kenya and Tanzania, respectively. The potential for increasing REDD+ activities in mangrove forests was evaluated based on effectiveness, efficiency, equity and co-benefits of pilot projects in carbon sequestration and in reducing emissions. The REDD+ pilot projects performed fairly well in the area of disseminating information on the REDD+ concept and on climate change in mangrove forests to wider communities. They were also ranked effective on capacity building because they trained village conservation committees on various methods to carry out REDD+ activities effectively. In addition, communities had high expectations on REDD+ pilot projects in providing economic incentives and support livelihood improvements to reduce pressure in mangrove forests.
The REDD+ pilot projects were rather efficient in supplementing efforts by the Kenya and Tanzania governments to protect and conserve mangrove forests, including being important in relieving expenditures of the governments in such efforts. It was found that the REDD+ pilot activities were implemented within existing networks of communities engaged in participatory forest management, thereby significantly reducing monitoring, enforcement and other costs. Despite the presence of permit systems, illegal activities in mangrove forests were escalating in the study areas, indicating that monitoring of rules of compliance by the community members was poorly enforced. This contributed to increased deforestation and degradation of mangrove forests. The REDD+ projects are concerned with providing all groups in the communities with incentives for more sustainable forest use, a strategy that is likely to increase a sense of ownership to the mangrove REDD+ projects and therefore contributing to preventing emissions of GHGs in mangrove forests.
The evaluation of co-benefits of mangrove REDD+ projects was based on the four dimensions of forest conservation, political change, socio-economic benefits, and adaptation to climate change. Regarding forest conservation, the study showed that mangrove tree planting was done to encourage reforestation, hence enhancing carbon stock. Some mangroves were retained on farms to ensure expansion and regeneration of mangrove resources. However, forest conservation was facing a big challenge as pressure placed on mangrove forests for firewood was high due to the increased population and use of traditional cooking stoves. In the area of political change, communities had low expectations from REDD+ projects to contribute to desired political change as officials and conservation committees were not accountable for forest protection, neither were they transparent and they were weak in applying the rule of law. Some of the pre-conditions for increased implementation of REDD+ activities in mangrove forests were found to be: proper signing of agreements, developing national REDD+ strategies, clear project eligibility, in-depth preparatory studies, knowledge on drivers of deforestation and degradation, leakage prevention activities, capacity building, and establishing carbon baselines for REDD+ projects.
Forest restoration was the best REDD+ practice in mangrove forests with regards to its contribution to climate change mitigation as it ranked first with a score of 45. Other climate change mitigation practices were: sustainable forest management, raising community income generation, boundary demarcation and social fencing, strengthening forest land tenure, strengthening community based organizations, avoided deforestation, support exchange visits, establishment of woodlots, and climate change awareness workshops. Agricultural and fishing intensification with a score of 38 was the best activity in mitigating the impacts of climate change in mangrove forest. Other contributing activities were: developing appropriate management plans, participatory management, enforcement of forest law and regulations, opening and closing system, community based eco-tourism, taungya system, enforcement of land use laws and regulations, sacred groves, and international reputation. In conclusion, there was considered to be a high potential for increased implementation of REDD+ activities in mangrove forest to reduce GHG emissions to the atmosphere. Currently, in mainland Tanzania, there are no REDD+ pilot projects per se in mangrove forests. Those found were just research projects for academic purposes. Therefore, REDD+ pilot projects in mangrove forests in mainland Tanzania should be encouraged because communities are willing to benefit from this new funding initiative.","Kitula, R.",2014,Working Paper,20410,10/12/2014 11:48,https://afforum.org/oldaff/sites/default/files/English/English_84.pdf,https://afforum.org/oldaff/sites/default/files/French/French_48.pdf
12603,An analytical review of forest governance and equitable trade practices related to climate change in Central Africa. Vol 2 (9).,"Forests play a crucial role in climate change evolution and dynamics. The effects of climate change may also greatly impact forest ecosystems, which will reflect on the living conditions of local forest-dependent people. To tackle threats from climate change, the international community promotes the setting up of policies and actions that can concomitantly contribute to reducing vulnerability and mitigating climate change effects. This includes the implementation of appropriate practices of conservation and actions for sustainable management of forests, which are likely to contribute substantially to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions as well as to the increase of carbon stock pools. Therefore, African countries, many of which are currently going through socio-economic and political changes, and are characterised by wide-spread poverty, must develop policies and concrete action plans geared at protecting their populations and forests from the threats of climate change. It is in this context that the project African Forests, People and Climate Change, developed and run by the African Forest Forum (AFF), is being implemented.
The objective of this study is to review and critically analyse forest governance and equitable trade practices related to climate change with a focus on the capacities of public forestry administrations in Central Africa (CA) countries. More specifically, the study focused on the following tasks: evaluate and profile the capacities (human, financial and physical) of national forest administrations in climate change work (including safeguards and Measuring, Reporting and Verification system (MRVs) in all CA countries; assess existing trade and trade potentials in forest products and services in individual CA countries and between the CA region and other sub-regions in Africa, and in the world at large; evaluate negative trade impacts of cross border trade between countries in CA, as well as market distortions in the context of the fuel-food nexus, and with special emphasis on deforestation and forest degradation (leakages); assess the efficiency in the value chain involving fibre (wood/timber products, including NTFPs) and fuel, and identify and describe approaches for improving the efficiency in the value chain. The emphasis is to assess efficiency in the value chain of key timber and non-timber products and how this can be improved, including comparisons between countries in CA on how they are  moving on the value chain; propose recommendations to improve forest governance, trade in timber and nontimber products, and livelihoods using forest and tree resources, taking into account potential impacts of climate change on these resources in CA. An analytical review of forest governance and equitable trade practices related to climate change in Central Africa
The data collection for the study was essentially based on the following approaches: review of forest policies and legislations for CA countries, as well as sub-regional legal instruments ratified within the framework of the Central Africa Forest
Commission (COMIFAC); documentation and literature review relating to forest governance, trade of forest products and climate change; consultation of quantitative data from FAO, ITTO, UNECA and the Observatory for the Forests of Central Africa (OFAC) statistical data bases; and, Individual interviews with ten key experts at the sub-regional level and within forest administrations (Cameroon, Republic of Congo, Gabon and the Democratic Republic of Congo). Therefore, this analytical review of forest governance and equitable trade practices related to climate change, with a focus on the capacities of public forestry administrations, reveals an ambivalent global picture and trend. On the one hand, CA is characterized by high forest resource potentials that can
contribute to the global concern of climate change impacts, nourish forest-dependent people and increase forest products trade flows inside and outside Africa, notably with improved processed wood. On the other hand, COMIFAC Member States are
weak on MRV capacities and financial means, NTFPs trade and monitoring, forest management and related practices that contribute to high rates of deforestation, and are suffering biodiversity loss. More precisely, this study points out that: CA has 37% of the total African forest resources; an average of 4.5 million m3 of wood is exported from CA per year, notably to EU; intra-African trade flows are still weak; the NTFPs niche is mostly dominated by informal practices; fuelwood collection, chainsaw milling, illegal harvesting, land use conflicts and forest land conversion to agriculture are the main drivers of deforestation and forest degradation; MRV capacities and domestic financial means are weak. However, the identified gaps and shortcomings could be partly improved with the adoption of some governance actions in the framework of the Regional Economic Communities (ReCs), that are being built in Africa, and the design and implementation processes of both the VPAs/FLEGT and REDD+ mechanisms. The
following measures must be taken. An analytical review of forest governance and equitable trade practices related to climate change in Central Africa a) National public forest administration and climate change Each CA country should set up a recruitment plan for the coming years to overcome the lack of sufficient domestic experts in their respective forest administrations. However, in the short term, the lack of appropriate expertise in MRV to better tackle climate change mitigation issues can be supplied by
participating in short training sessions and capacity development on national forest monitoring skills, which can be provided and supported by some organisations such as AFF. Currently, most CA countries (except CAR, DRC) have not yet built vulnerability
maps and adaptation policies and related strategies. In this perspective, there is a niche for regional organisations like AFF to give technical support to those countries that are trying to develop such policies and strategies connected to forest management and forest dependent communities. b) Forest governance and socio-economic development Forest and trade governance must be improved through adequate remuneration and strict disciplinary measures to reduce corruption of custom official, forest officers and local administration and police. Social and economic development should be promoted, particularly in remote and isolated border areas, and marketing of locally produced wood and NTFPs should be facilitated in those areas to increase competitiveness. Meet the expectations of the US and European markets to verify the legitimacy of imported timber by initiating or completing ongoing processes (VPA/FLEGT and Lacey Act). Also in this perspective, AFF could be involved (as independent observer) by monitoring, reporting and verifying (MRV) their implementation. c) Forest products trade and services Increase local wood processing conversion rates. This could further diversify processed products by developing industrial processing and encouraging the use of timber and NTFPs in African countries. Provide technical support and an enabling market information system as well as value chain platforms for individual and small/medium scale enterprises in countries and cross-border areas. AFF is one of the organisations that can fulfil
this role by providing support. Trade flows of forests products should be monitored, including the issue of crossborder trade, which should be added to the agenda of quarterly, semi-annual and annual bilateral meetings among countries. In this perspective, AFF can play a key role by elaborating and providing facilitating tools. d) Cross border trade and deforestation and forest degradation An analytical review of forest governance and equitable trade practices related to climate change in Central Africa
Find ways of improving the performance of CEMAC and ECCAS by conducting studies that will lead to a better understanding of the weaknesses and threats to the functioning of these organizations, and advice member countries on the opportunities and strengths for effective regional integration. Elaborate a framework for the involvement of forest communities through a winwin business development approach with the local and international agroindustrial enterprises involved in the forest sector in the CA region. e) Efficiency in the value chain of timber and NTFPs CA countries should increase the efficiency of the forest product value chains by taking stringent measures to reduce the export of raw materials and promoting the production of processed and further processed wood products such as wood based panels, paperboards, fibre boards, furniture and wooden cabinets. AFF can help by identifying improved technologies that are adapted to national and regional needs. There is need to strengthen intra-regional trade and remove cross-border bottlenecks. AFF can assist in conducting research that showcase what countries stand to gain from efficiency in regional trade.","Assembe-Mvondo, S.",2014,Working Paper,20396,10/12/2014 11:21,https://afforum.org/oldaff/sites/default/files/English/English_81.pdf,https://afforum.org/oldaff/sites/default/files/French/French_45.pdf
12604,Climate change mitigation activities in the Tropical Moist Forests of West Africa. Vol 2 (16).,"Tropical moist forests (TMFs) occur in humid tropical areas, usually with 1,500 mm or more of precipitation and a dry season (or seasons) of three to four months or less. There is an interrupted belt of TMFs along the West African coast characterized by dense mass of evergreens and oil palms. The Upper Guinean TMFs extend from Guinea and Sierra Leone in the west through Liberia, Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana all the way to Nigeria and a few hundred kilometers inland from the Atlantic coast. The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) designated the Upper Guinean forests, which it calls the Guinean moist forests, as one of its Global 200 critical regions for conservation. The WWF divides the Upper Guinean forests into three eco-regions, including the Western Guinean lowland forests that extend from Guinea and Sierra Leone through Liberia and southeastern Côte d'Ivoire as far as the Sassandra River, Guinean montane forests found at higher elevations in the highlands of central Guinea, northern Sierra Leone, and eastern Côte d'Ivoire, and the eastern Guinean forests that extend east from the Sassandra River through Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana to western Togo, with a few isolated enclaves further inland in the highlands of central Togo
and Benin.
The TMFs and climate change have significant impacts on national economies and social systems. Customary law often gives residents the right to use trees for firewood, fell trees for construction, collect forest products and rights for hunting and grazing or clearing of forests for agriculture. There are also protected forests, where uncontrolled clearings and unauthorized logging are forbidden. However, with the current developmental dilemma facing West Africa, degradation of the TMF appears imminent unless developers start to work outside the box to find innovative green solutions to identified problems. Loss of TMFs occurred greatly in countries with higher population growth. Rapid and uncontrolled population accentuates social, economic as well as environmental problems. Actual rate of deforestation varies from one country to another. In Guinea, Liberia and the Ivory Coast, there is almost no primary forest cover left unscathed. In Ghana and Nigeria, the situation is much worse, and nearly all the rainforests are cut down. At the present trend of deforestation, experts estimate that the rainforests of West Africa may disappear by the year 2020. Moist forests and woodlands are declining primarily as a result of increased wood fuel collection, clearing of forests for agriculture, illegal and poorly regulated timber extraction, land tenure conflicts, increasing urbanization and industrialization. In the face of the rapidly diminishing forest and biodiversity, REDD+ represents an opportunity for partnership between developing and industrialized countries for the benefit of the global climate system. Developing countries would participate by undertaking REDD+ actions while industrialized countries participate by sharing the costs associated with the Climate change mitigation activities in the Tropical Moist Forests of West Africa actions. REDD+ can also lead to direct social benefits, such as jobs, livelihoods, land tenure clarification, carbon payments, enhanced participation in decision-making and improved governance. For all these benefits, complementary stand of the African Forest Forum (AFF) to assist African nations willing to embark on REDD+ is a vital and welcome agenda. Forest-based Plan Vivo-accredited project in the West African TMFs is currently lacking. REDD+ readiness activities in the TMFs of Ghana, Liberia and Nigeria were, therefore, discussed, with information provided on Cote dIvoire, Guinea Bissau and Sierra Leone to the extent available. The objective was to integrate all information on the West African humid forests to catalyze initiatives at national, regional and international levels, which may foster the adoption of REDD+ principles throughout the eco-region. As resources dwindle and the agricultural frontier expands, pressure to convert the TMFs will increase. Thus, the forest situation in tropical West Africa presents enormous challenges, reflecting the larger constraints of low income, weak policies and inadequately developed institutions.
Successful implementation of REDD+ in the sub-region is, however, linked to the reliability of historical forest database, programmes aimed at restoring the fragile ecosystem, the indigenous peoples experience, institutional capacity and economic potential that improve the well-being of local communities. It may be useful for AFF to evolve programmes aimed at periodically compiling and publishing data on national forest budget allocations and disbursements for comparative evaluation and encouragement to do better.
Greater leverage through REDD+ is achievable through improved forest and environmental education, clear definition of local project needs and priorities that are sensitive to the landscape and implementation that ensures long-term confidence in the demand for REDD+ units while avoiding leakages or displaced pressures. AFF could inject momentum in REDD+ demonstration and awareness raising by helping to generate videos, mimeos and documentaries on threatened ecosystems and the degraded habitats, and the reasons for their protection and restoration.
Climate change mitigation using REDD+ can be triggered through motivational apparatus following map-based analysis of the degraded eco-zones, consultations to identify country needs and priorities as well as identification of opportunities and multiple benefits. The concept could be enhanced through funding and cash incentives, better fire control and management, clean and lean development technologies and agro-forestry. The sustainability indices include equity, value addition forestry, policy reforms and setting up
networks of protected areas in contiguous countries. AFF should get involved in negotiations that make Carbon Revenue from REDD+ projects equal or greater than Opportunity Cost of other land use options. This is because if REDD payments do not match or surpass the lost opportunity cost of competing uses, the Climate change mitigation activities in the Tropical Moist Forests of West Africa associated activities may not be justified. However, a one-size-fits-all approach to monitoring biodiversity in REDD+ projects would not only be difficult to develop, but would likely fail given vast differences in forest ecology and threats across West Africa. Instead, local sites should be encouraged to develop monitoring programs based on a generally approved roadmap.
The main benefits of REDD+ are embedded in its capacity to: (i) enhance economic potential of stakeholders; (ii) draw on indigenous peoples experience in evolving best practices; (iii) enhance map-based identification of the threatened moist forest habitats in each country; (iv) secure tree and forest tenure and rights to the use of timber and other forest resources; (v) improve information and knowledge of forest resource assessment; and (vi) equip institutions responsible for forest resources to implement REDD+ projects effectively.
Strong potential for up- and out-scaling REDD+ in the TMFs of West Africa are found in: (i) environmental education - forest and environmental education must be enhanced because development and sustainability are at stake; (ii) broad policy reforms that raise the profile of climate change for capacity development; (iii) clear understanding of environmental services to be paid for; (iv) eco-labelling to sustain forest management practices; (v) stakeholder involvement and participation that calls for consensus and cross-sectorial coordination; and (vi) making Free Prior Informed Consent (FPIC) on on-going processes, rather than a single event, and adequate time allowed for their careful management.
AFF could also look into operational and organizational barriers to further development of community-based Forest Groups and suggest remedies while injecting motion required for promoting forest regeneration concessions. It is also desirable to strengthen institutions (e.g. Forestry Departments and Commissions) established to manage West African TMFs to develop advance deforestation tracking system. In the future, how large emission reductions from REDD+ would be depends on a significant number of assumptions. One critical variable is the amount of funding available for REDD+. The other critical variable is the possibility of international leakage, i.e. how reduced deforestation in one country or site might lead to increased emission in non-participating areas. As a matter of fact, REDD+ design, objectives and promotion deserve careful attention to avoid risk of displaced pressure and secure increased implementation.
AFF could help to develop minimum standards in the readiness phase of REDD+ in Africa to safeguard and ensure stakeholders agreement on the mode of monitoring and measuring carbon pools. This will build market confidence in the long-term sustainability
and demand for REDD+ units. AFF could also help to establish reliable baselines and robust monitoring approaches for advancing REDD in the West African sub-region, including the need for investment in Climate change mitigation activities in the Tropical Moist Forests of West Africa inventory and ground truthing capacity as well as remote sensing. Communities can be empowered if they have the means to monitor carbon stocks and make decisions. Accounting for benefit from REDD+ would relate to the emission reductions of the project minus leakage. Credits will be awarded if emissions from deforestation can be kept below the historical baseline reference emission rate. Thus, in areas where local land tenure rights are recognized, projects can result in clear benefits to local communities. REDD+ funds could be used to finance a multitude of different policies and measures, such as forest protection policies, improved enforcement of protected areas, expansion and better implementation of participatory forest management, and land reform processes like tenure reform surrounding the issue of landlords and tenant farmers.
Finally, exploiters of forest products must commit to responsible and sound practices, and assume more of the costs of their impacts. With these practices, and if stakeholders work in concerted efforts, the TMFs may continue to yield biological, economic and social benefits well into the future. It is desirable that AFF should inaugurate recognition awards to model West African countries doing well in promoting the sustainability of TMFs.","Akande, J.

12605,The Great Green Wall of Sahara and Sahel initiative: climate change and gender issues. Working Paper Vol. 2 (2).,"African countries have been facing several environmental challenges related to climate change and desertification. To cope with these challenges, several efforts have been made by individual countries to implement projects and programmes related to desertification control, management of natural resources and to the improvement of living conditions and incomes of people, particularly in rural areas. At technical and institutional levels, policies and strategies have been developed by African countries to strengthen their commitment to implementing regional and global initiatives, such as the three United Nations Conventions on Biological Diversity, Climate Change, and on Combating Desertification. But it has
recently been realised that these individual efforts have great limitations as challenges often go beyond national borders.
In this regard, CEN-SAD (Community of Sahel and Sahara States) Leaders and Heads of States adopted in June 2005 in Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso) the Great Green Wall Initiative as an afforestation programme to respond to the combined effects of natural environmental degradation, droughts and desert encroachment. The concept evolved to an integrated rural development programme that addresses combating desertification, land degradation and deforestation, and improving the livelihoods of local people.
The initiative has later been endorsed by the African Union as a Pan-African initiative with an agency created in 2010 by 11 Sahelian desert frontline countries to oversee the implementation of the initiative in the participating countries. Some of these countries, with the support of international and regional institutions, have developed and adopted their national strategies and plans for the implementation the initiative and established their national agencies. The Pan-African Agency of the Great Green Wall for the Sahara and Sahel Initiative (PA/GGWSSI) developed a consolidated action plan of implementation based on national documents. Most of these (strategies and actions plans of implementation) were developed based on agreed pillars of interventions with the aims of containing natural resources degradation, including forest and tree resources, and improving the social and economic welfare of communities. Also cross-cutting issues, such as gender and vulnerable groups, are considered. National strategies and international conventions and policies were also considered in order to align the initiative to national and international environmental agreements.
The implementation stage of the action plans differs from one country to another based on the level of financial resources mobilisation. The Great Green Wall of Sahara and Sahel Initiative: climate change and gender issues © African Forest Forum (August 2014)
All stakeholders supporting this process at national and regional levels have been acknowledged with recommendations to improve the way they support the initiative. The African Forest Forum, being a strong platform for African forestry, should play a key role in assisting both individual countries and the Pan-African Agency with technical, political and advocacy support.","Abdou, M.",2014,Working Paper,20400,10/12/2014 11:01,https://afforum.org/oldaff/sites/default/files/English/English_79.pdf,https://afforum.org/oldaff/sites/default/files/French/French_43.pdf
12606,"Practices, techniques and technologies for restoring degraded landscapes in the Sahel. Working Paper Vol. 2 (3).","The different agro-ecological zones of Sahelian countries have experienced continuous degradation for the last four decades due to the combined effects of drought, increasing anthropogenic pressure on the limited natural resources available, deforestation and
degradation of wood resources, reduced fallow period, intensification of cropping, overexploitation of water and pasture resources, etc. These malpractices have resulted in a decrease in the productivity of the prevailing Sahelian agro-silvo-pastoral land use systems. In response to this crisis, many international agencies and donor organisations have provided support to Governments and people in the Sahel aiming at developing technical, environmental and agricultural strategies and approaches for achieving sustainable and productive management of the environment and improving the quality of the different land resources. This support, mainly in response to the humanitarian and environmental crises that brought severe famine and resulted in the loss of large areas of cropland, rangeland and forestland, has focused on soil and water conservation and restoration techniques. Thus, many projects in these decades of recurrent droughts have developed activities related to land improvement and development practices and to natural resources conservation.
After these decades of drought and famine, and following the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, most Sahelian countries have developed strategies and national action plans and programmes for combating desertification and for improved management of
natural resources in order to meet the commitments undertaken by signing and ratifying the Post-Rio international conventions, i.e. the Conventions for Combating Desertification (CCD), for Conserving Biological Diversity (CBD) and for mitigating Climate Change
(UNFCCC). As a result, issues of environmental degradation, including desertification and degradation of natural resources such as forests, woodlands and trees, have received increased international attention.  In their efforts to implement these Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs), most Sahelian countries have made significant progress in the fight against desertification, and for environmental protection and the rehabilitation of degraded lands, forests and woodlands. Much efforts has also been directed by countries towards technical, financial and institutional matters through implementation of several projects and programmes for desertification control, management of natural resources and improvement of income and living conditions of rural people. Various sustainable management techniques and practices, including farmer assisted natural regeneration, soil protection and conservation, and water conservation, have been implemented in the field. At the institutional level, Practices, techniques and technologies for restoring degraded landscapes in the sahel © African Forest Forum (August 2014) All Rights Reserved policies and strategies have been elaborated to strengthen countries commitment to implementing regional and international initiatives.
Restoration of degraded land is increasingly a key requirement in a context where food security is one of the main objectives for sustainable development of the countries. Many policies and strategies that were developed, and the action plans and programmes that are in place; focus on micro-economic interventions. These are are heavily subsidised and unfortunately, do not consider the broader policies. With the launching of the TerrAfrica process, Sustainable Land Management (SLM) is considered in most Sahelian countries as an imperative development tool for harmonising interventions within and between the major sub-sectors, such as agriculture, livestock, forestry, water resources and environment. It has been widely accepted that SLM can promote cross-sector integration, as recommended in the Agenda 21 and the Poverty Reduction Strategies elaborated and adopted by most Sahelian countries for achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). In fact, most Sahelian countries have elaborated and adopted sustainable investment frameworks for sustainable land management (SIFSLM) for scaling up and mainstreaming best practices, techniques and technologies in this domain. The main components of the SIF-SLM include:

providing adequate funding for scaling up SLM practices, techniques and technologies in the field, such as farmer managed natural regeneration, water harvesting technologies, soil fertility improvement techniques, afforestation, bush fire control measures, management of forests and protected areas, establishing flora and fauna reserves, elaboration and implementation of forest and woodland management plans, etc.;
strengthening the enabling environment for SLM practices, including improving institutional, political and financial support to SLM through: i) the implementation of a support programme for improving the institutional and financial capacities required for implementing SIF-SLM as a framework for National Strategies and Programmes for Food Security; ii) strengthening national mechanisms for SLM financial resource mobilisation from the coalition of financial and technical partners and others, mobilising relevant innovative funding sources, and increasing the national SLM budget; and, enhancing the legislative and regulatory environment for SLM by integratiing SLM into policies, strategies, projects and cross-sector programmes at all administrative levels;
enhancing the advisory roles of the technical services and improving the participation of the private sector in the implementation of best SLM practices, techniques and technologies through the development of harmonised planning and the promotion of marketable goods and services from SLM practices;
developing necessary tools for data collection, analysis and information dissemination to all local users and decision makers; Practices, techniques and technologies for restoring degraded landscapes in the sahel

strengthening the capacities of all stakeholders in using SLM approaches, strategies, practices and techniques, and promote the implementation of SIF-SLM through various training sessions of all actors (civil society, private sector, local authorities, and public sector organisations of producers, etc.) involved in SLM;
providing adequate funding for the development and application of monitoring tools and SLM information systems, and building capacity for implementing them in order to allow stakeholders to better monitor land resource uses and changes and to transfer knowledge necessary for sustaining post-project impact, thereby contributing to greater adoption of climate-smart land, water and forest management.","Abdo, M.",2014,Working Paper,20392,10/12/2014 10:46,https://afforum.org/oldaff/sites/default/files/English/English_74.pdf,https://afforum.org/oldaff/sites/default/files/French/French_38.pdf

12609,"Training modules on forest based climate change adaptation, mitigation, carbon trading, and payment for other environmental services","Capacity building in forestry in all its forms is a central work area for the African Forest Forum (AFF). It was on this basis that AFF organized a workshop on capacity building and skills development in forestbased climate change adaptation and mitigation in Nairobi, Kenya on November 12-16, 2012, that drew 54 participants from selected academic, research and civil society institutions, as well as from the private sector and youth. The participants came from 22 countries, namely Benin, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Côte dIvoire, Ethiopia, Gabon, Zambia, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Mali, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sudan, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda and Zimbabwe. It was also attended by staff from FAO and ICRAF.
The workshop identified the training needs on addressing the relationship between forests and climate change for educational and related forestry based training institutions at professional and technical levels, as well as for informal groups that are mainly made up of civil society organizations and local communities. Training needs and modules to guide training were developed based on agro-ecological regions of Sub-Sahara Africa. These are arid and semi-arid regions, including Sahelian belt; the savannas and woodlands of West, Eastern and Southern Africa; and the rainforests of West and Central Africa. Separate analyses were done for Anglophone and Lusophone countries as a block, and for Francophone countries as another block, given the different educational systems in these two language blocks. These training modules therefore fill the gaps observed by the training institutions.
In order to carry this work forward AFF organized, in 2013, four subregional workshops to first improve on the needs and contents of the modules as well as validating the same. The workshops also served as avenues to better orient/ retool staff from academic, research, extension and civil society organizations in key areas of science and practice of climate change as it relates to forests, and basing such training on these modules. A total of 111 people from academia, research, public sector, private sector, youth and civil society in Sub-Sahara Africa have been involved in the development and validation of the needs and the training modules.
In 2013, AFF conducted country training using the modules in Ethiopia, Niger and Zambia; more countries will be covered in the near future. AFF first developed the teaching materials that will later be developed into specific compendiums. It would appear that there are no other institutions that are preparing such teaching materials for forestry training in Sub-Sahara Africa and on the same scope. AFF seeks to use, to the extent possible, XIV Training modules on forest based climate change adaptation, mitigation, carbon trading, and payment for other environmental services the capacity in the continent to develop local solutions to forestry problems; and teaching materials is one area where AFF will continue to engage the expertise on the continent to develop them. We welcome interested individuals and institutions to make full and free use of these training modules in their work.",African Forest Forum,2014,Training Module,20314,7/28/2022 10:25,http://afforum.org/oldaff/sites/default/files/English/English_103.pdf,http://afforum.org/oldaff/sites/default/files/French/French_57.pdf
12610,Development of forestry in Swedenany lessons for Africa?.  In Discov. Innov. Vol 21 (1),"During the SFM I project, studies were made on the relevance to Africa of Swedens experience in 100150 years to become a successful forestry country. Six major issues have influenced the development of forests, forestry and forest industries in Sweden. The first relates to the societal, economic and political macro-trends of the last 150 yearsdemocratisation, industrialisation, urbanisation, etc. Obviously, developments in forestry have been influenced, and to a significant degree, made possible by these factors. Five other key issues help explain the current forest situation: that wood early on acquired a commercial value and that private land owners, the Government and industry exploited the opportunities to add extra value by industrial processing; that ownership of forests was largely in private hands (farmers and industry); that forest policies and legislation were put in place to support the developments in forestry; the role of NGOs; and the roles of Government.
Although ecological and economic conditions are obviously different, it was concluded that many Swedish lessons related to the processes and mechanisms of developing and administrating forest policies and legislation, strengthening institutional capacity for supporting mechanisms to SFM, e.g. within areas of research, education/ training, resource inventories and statistics, extension services, certification and market intelligence, etc., and in organising and empowering stake-holders in the use, management and conservation of forest and tree resources, could be of relevance, in adapted forms, also to Africa.","Lundgren, B.",2009,Journal Article,,16/12/2013 13:17,http://afforum.org/sites/default/files/English/English_58.pdf,
12611,Processing and marketing of non-wood forest products: potential impacts and challenges in Africa.   In Innov. Vol 21 (1),"This paper provides an overview and synthesis of the processing and marketing of NWFP in Africa. Indeed, NWFPs provide a livelihood support system for forest communities and poor urban households in terms of food, medicines, income and employment. However, forest communities remain poor, always struggling to make a living rather than improving their status quo. This trend raises concern whether NWFPs constitute a poverty trap, a safety net or a resource for rural development and poverty alleviation. This paper tries to address some of these concerns with the main objective of drawing lessons from experiences across the African continent on the opportunities and challenges of the NWFPs sector. Such lessons are considered very important in informing the development of policies in future that can better contribute and sustain the provision of income and livelihood to stakeholders. Lessons drawn from this analysis shows that organised production, processing and marketing of NWFPs can increase the revenue of dependent communities, thereby contributing to poverty reduction in Africa. The paper concludes that the salient requirements for the development of the NWFP include adding value locally, choosing the right marketing strategy, informing local producers and organisations on legal procedures, supporting and building capacities of vibrant/accountable local organisations, conducting cost effective research and development, and disseminating appropriate information on the resource base and on market conditions.","Tieguhong, J.

Conditions that enable long-term viability in the management of forests for NWFPs and services have been reviewed. Need for sound ecological data in relation to resource stock and yield were noted as important in determining ecological sustainability. A number of institutional issues important to SFM were noted, including setting up of strong producer organizations, enabling policies and legislative frameworks, and relevant institutions within the government that provide supportive roles. Multiple use management was noted as an important concept towards sustainable forestry and clearly demonstrates how forests can be managed for both wood and NWFPs.

It is found that efficiency in plantation management and success in achieving sustainable wood supply depends to a large extent on whether the plantations are owned and managed by the public or the private sector. Many public sector managed plantations are poorly managed and not profit-oriented. They have other environmental and social services and benefits as objectives. Many benefits from such activities are not easily quantifiable in monetary terms and therefore cannot be used to determine the profitability of the plantations. Thus, in financial analysis, most public sector owned and managed plantations are unprofitable and not economically viable because these important benefits are excluded in the calculations. Private owned forest plantations are well managed and aim at profit maximization and therefore integrate plantations to wood processing plants to improve the form and value of wood and make the wood products more competitive in both domestic and export markets. As a way forward, a number of actions are listed to ensure long-term viability of forest plantations in SSA.","Chamshama, S. A. O., Nwonwu, F.O.C.  Lundgren, B. & Kowero, G.

Vol 21 (1),"The paper presents the state of forests in sub-Saharan African (SSA)countries, salient factors leading to forest loss, the influence of mitigating measures being adopted, and an assessment of the community based forest management systems(CBFM). The study reveals that a number of promising CBFM constructs have been tried and more are being implemented in the region. Implementation progress shows that virtually all countries have enacted supportive policies, legislations, institutional instruments and reforms. Notable trajectories contributing to sustainable forest management, with prospects for enhancing social justice, economic, environmental, social institutions and human capital, are noted. Bottlenecks stifling CBFMs growth, particularly those associated with conflicts, challenges, constraints and threats are examined. In a final chapter, the paper recommends a need to establish an inclusive platform to guide institutional reforms and to mount a comprehensive research programme.

12616,Mainstreaming international forestry related agreements at national level.   In Innov. Vol 21 (1),"The case study provides in-sights on initiation, negotiation and implementation of International Forestry Related Agreements (IFRAs). It is observed and concluded that (i) there is low and inconsistent participation by Africa in international forest processes that lead to IFRAs, ostensibly due to lack of funds, (ii) Africa is not influencing the outcomes of the processes, (ii) African national institutions face challenges in mainstreaming outcomes IFRAs, not only due to lack of capacity, but also because of poor ownership of the outcomes, (iv) African forestry institutions have many overlapping international and regional initiatives to deal with that require substantial resources, which are not readily available, (v) there is inadequate participation by the private sector, (vi) countries send different individuals to successive forums resulting in lack of institutional and policy memory and hence continuity. In extreme cases, this has resulted in countries taking contradictory positions on specific issues in successive sessions, (vii) many countries send delegations without adequate preparation, and (viii) many countries lack competent resource persons to handle issues under discussion. In some cases, there is little understanding and consensus at national level on issues under international debate. As a result of the foregoing, there is limited awareness and appreciation within African governments on existence of the instruments and countries lack a critical mass of people knowledgeable on them. Accordingly, it is not easy to mainstream IFRAs into national policies, laws and strategies. A structured layered approach for participation and feedback is proposed to expedite effectiveness and implementation.","Kamugisha-Ruhombe, J.",2009,Journal Article,,16/12/2013 12:52,http://afforum.org/sites/default/files/English/English_40.pdf,

The current weak capacities and low profiles of PFA in SSA countries are addressed and some recommendations are made on actions for positive changes. It is recommended that SSA countries should take appropriate steps to stabilize and strengthen their PFAs through improved governance and to actively participate in the emerging initiative on African forest law enforcement and governance (AFLEG). It is recommended that SSA countries should take immediate steps to mobilize additional resources for PFAs through forest income retention schemes, national forest funds/trusts and through collaboration with nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and the private sector. It is also recommended that SSA countries should mobilize resources through continental and/or regional initiatives on capacity building for PFA.","Owino, F.",2009,Journal Article,,16/12/2013 12:43,http://afforum.org/sites/default/files/English/English_52.pdf,
12618,Some Drivers of Change in Forest Conditions in Africa. In Innov. Vol 21 (1),"Forests in Africa are important to livelihoods of rural communities, as habitats of wildlife, sources of genetic resources and for mitigation to climate change among many other uses. Africas area under forests is, however, declining at rates faster than those in other continents despite efforts to improve forest management by, for example, devolving ownership and management of some of these forests to local communities. This paper examines some of the root causes of this decline by specifically focusing on the forest-society and agriculture nexus as one of the key drivers of forest depletion on the continent. The paper also examines the influence of urbanisation and related policy shifts in Africa. The paper concludes that the rapid population increase has direct negative impact on forests and this is compounded by increasing poverty in rural areas that has increased reliance on forests as sources of food, medicines, agricultural land, in addition to forests supplying wood and other non-wood forest products for domestic consumption and industrial needs. The paper highlights an apparent link between deforestation and urbanization, and the potentials for African forests to contribute more to social and economic development and to mitigate adverse effects of climate change.","Kowero, G., Njuki, J. & Nair, C.T.S.",2009,Journal Article,,16/12/2013 12:40,http://afforum.org/sites/default/files/English/English_27.pdf,

Activity Outline
Forest certification schemes are based on developing two strategic tools. Firstly, national performance standards, developed in consensus with national forest stakeholders to be applied at the level of a forest management unit. Secondly, systems to inspect and evaluate forest management against agreed standards
The need for institutions that will mainstream and guide the process of Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT), is fundamental
Forest certification on its own cannot ensure commercial success. It is important that forest product processing is of a high quality. However, forest certification in combination with a high quality product can give access to high value markets.

12644,African forests and forestry: an overview,"Forests and woodlands cover vast areas of Africa, representing a substantial percentage of global forest cover. Tropical moist forests in Central and parts of West Africa and woodlands in Southern Africa are the dominant formations. The Democratic Republic of Congo, Sudan, Angola, Zambia, and Mozambique contain the majority of Africa's forest areas.
Africa also has widespread areas extending over hundreds of millions of hectares classified as 'other wooded land', such as the savannas of Eastern Africa and the Sudano-Sahelian region.
Together with the fertile highlands of Eastern and Southern Africa Forests and woodlands cover vast areas of Africa, representing a substantial percentage of global forest cover. Tropical moist forests in Central and parts of West Africa and woodlands in Southern Africa are the dominant formations. The Democratic Republic of Congo, Sudan, Angola, Zambia, and Mozambique contain the majority of Africas forest areas.
Africa also has widespread areas extending over hundreds of millions of hectares classified as other wooded land, such as the savannas of Eastern Africa and the Sudano-Sahelian region. Together with the fertile highlands of Eastern and Southern Africa, these are the same agroecological zones where much of Africas agriculture, human and animal population concentrations are found
Montane forests are ecologically and hydrologically vitally important, and found around mountains and highlands in Eastern Africa.
Mangrove forests along the African coast, and riverine forests along water courses, are also part of the natural forest formations in Africa.
Man-made plantations cover only limited parts of Africas total forest area, with South Africa, Sudan, Nigeria and Morocco contributing substantially to this kind of forest cover. Large scale commercial forest operations are found in the plantation-based forest industry in the South, and in the concession-based timber extraction and saw milling industry in Central and Western African. Small quantities of plantation and naturally grown timber constitute the basis for small scale forest industry across the continent.
Africa's share of the global value of wood removals remains significantly lower than its potential. Firewood and charcoal are by far the most significant components of these removals, but cottage industry produced furniture, local construction material, woodcraft, utility goods, and a variety of non-wood products including fruits, medicines, fodder and honey, also originate from various forest types. There is a growing volume of timber traded directly from farms and community managed forests to the primary forest industry, creating links between the informal and formal sectors.
More than half a million people in Africa are involved in the primary production of goods in forests. Employment varies considerably, and there is a scarcity of information on this issue. A significant proportion of wood production and processing takes place in the informal sector and has not been adequately reported on
Deforestation and degradation are accelerating at alarming rates in many parts of Africa, mainly caused by the transfer of forest land into agriculture and other uses.Some deforestation can also be attributed to non-sustainable exploitation of wood for fuel, timber and other products, leading to a situation where forest management and utilization are increasingly seen as causing negative impacts on forest-dependent people, climate, biodiversity and water. The enormous economic, food security and environmental benefits to be derived from an increasing and sustainably managed forest and tree estate are underestimated, often as a result of inadequate information and appreciation of the potential value of well managed trees and forests.
This problem derives partially from national forest institutions which, with some notable exceptions, are weak and have limited influence on policy and investment decisions. Likewise, forest expertise is weak in most regional and sub-regional institutions which are increasingly shaping the development agenda. The international discourse on how Africa should manage its natural resources has not focused on forestry issues, with a tendency to highlight environmental problems rather than social and economic opportunities associated with forest/tree management.","Nair, C.T.S. & Tieguhong, J.",2004,Report,,8/11/2013 1:59,http://afforum.org/sites/default/files/English/English_36.pdf,

It is convincingly argued by many experts that the only way to avoid shortage of wood in the near future is to meet these demands from rationally managed tree plantations on much smaller areas than would be required for equivalent production from natural vegetation. Furthermore, many secondary wood industries (furniture, paper, etc.) require wood of reasonably uniform and predictable quality, a strong argument in favour of plantations. In addition, tree plantations are often the most rational way of producing also nonwood forest products, for rehabilitation of degraded areas and improvement of watersheds, and for meeting environmental objectives such as windbreaks, shelterbelts and, more recently, carbon sequestration.","Chamshama, S.A.O. & Nwonwu, F.O.C",2009,Policy Brief,,23/08/2013 22:34,http://afforum.org/sites/default/files/English/English_110.pdf,

Vol 1 (5),"The African Forest Forum (AFF) in a study on professional forestry associations in southern Africa found out that a majority of formerly active professional forestry associations have gone moribund for several reasons. However, South Africa is the exception in that it has a number of active forest related associations that are backed by a vigorous industrial base. They are well placed to influence public policies in support of the forestry sector. In addition, several countries including Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe have associations of producers, traders and manufactures of forest products. Despite this, there is tremendous interest in virtually every country to strengthen, revive or establish new professional forestry associations; largely motivated by the income generation and poverty reduction 'policy push' in virtually every country; and more recently, the new opportunities in forestry to reduce CO2 emissions under REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation) and Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) schemes. The AFF considers it an opportune moment to strengthen, establish or revive both professional and industry associations in a continent that is increasingly becoming aware of the potential role of forests and trees, their contribution to national incomes, livelihoods, and stability of the environment.

Threats to African woodlands include (i) their conversion to cropland, arising from population growth and economic policies, (ii) urbanization, (iii) over dependence on wood-based energy sources, (iv) unsustainable harvesting of wood products, (v) fire and (vi) climate change and variability. From 1990 to 2000, it was estimated that woodland countries in sub-Saharan Africa lost nearly 5 million ha of forest cover annually; that is nearly 1.7% of the forest cover in 2000 (FAO, 2005).","Chidumayo, E., Okali, D., Kowero, G. & Larwanou, M.

12671,Forest-Water Relations in sub-humid West Africa.  Vol 1 (1).,"With 28 shared river basins covering 71% of the region, sub-humid West Africa would appear to have considerable water resources. This also makes the countries in the region very much water interdependent. However, evidence abounds that for the last one century many parts of the region have faced severe water stress. This has been traced in part to the varying climate in the sub-region. Most of the southern part of the region enjoys relatively adequate and bi-modal rainfall between March and October, while the drier northern part has a uni-modal regime of rainfall lasting barely four months in a year. In addition to climatic variations, the situation is complicated further due to the fact that the region's major watercourses have their sources in high rainfall areas and flow through the Sahelian zone. Several interventions have been made to harness and optimize the benefits from this resource, including the construction of large dams as water receptacles and for the regulation of flows. Even with these efforts the water stress in many parts of the sub-region remains a big problem. As part of its contribution to managing the African forests sustainably, as well as generating and sharing knowledge and information for sustainable forest management, the African Forest Forum commissioned a study on the broad area of forestwater relations, covering eight sub-humid West African countries of Benin, Ghana, Guinea Conakry, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Togo. The issues addressed in this study include: the extent of shared commitment and desire to promote synergy and strengthen cooperation of the member states on water, water issues in the sub-region, water supply in the region as related to forest ecosystems, learning and sharing of experiences and best practices, potential for collaboration in managing and using water resources and related forest ecosystems in the sub-region. This was essentially a desk study primarily aimed at identifying the major water resources in the sub-region, how they are linked to various forest ecosystems that serve as water catchment forests, and challenges and opportunities in managing these forests to improve supply of quality water to the sub-region. The report therefore addresses issues relating to forest and water supply, and more specifically the key water sheds and river basins as they relate to supporting forest ecosystems, issues in management of forests in water catchment areas including aspects related to policies, regulations, challenges and opportunities. The report identifies stakeholders in water resources and recommends ways for harmonising their interests with respect to water supply, use, trade and management. It also proposes improvements in knowledge and information sharing. Also some ideas are given on the way forward with water resources, including sub-region-wide coordinated policy and legislative actions and incentives that will enhance forest management for sustainable water supply and protection  of water catchment areas. It proffers the use of adaptive technologies to enhance water yield and use in the sub-region.

The Congo Basin (CB) forest is highly rich in biodiversity and contain mineral deposits of economic importance. The forest is under threat as a result of human activities including: agriculture (slash and burn and agro-industry plantations), mining, logging, infrastructural development, fuelwood extraction. Underlying factors that pose threat to the forest cover include: demographic pressure, political instability, weak governance and institutional arrangements and the quest for economic growth. The forest cover has witnessed a change over the last three decades. The deforestation rate for the CB forest between 1990 and 2000 was estimated at 0.09% while the forest degradation rate for the same period was estimated at 0.05%. Between 2000 and 2005, the deforestation and forest degradation rates of the region was estimated at 0.17% and 0.09% respectively. Of the CB countries, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has the highest rate of deforestation and forest degradation while Equatorial Guinea emerged as the country with the least deforestation rate.

This study presents the results of an investigation on the role that forests and trees can play
in helping African societies adapt to climate change and mitigate greenhouse gases from
the atmosphere. In this regard, it seeks to strengthen and further develop the forest –
climate nexus, a key issue for Africa’s future development. The study was framed around
eight sub-study areas and carried out through visits to five sampled Francophone African
countries based on geographical location and forest type. They include: Burkina Faso, Côte
d’Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Madagascar and Cameroon. Respondents
were drawn from six institutional groups, namely; government, intergovernmental
organisations, international organisations, research organizations and agencies, civil society
organisations, and the private forestry sector. The study revealed that there are three key
determinants for the wider adoption of adaptation and mitigation interventions. They revolve
around fiscal, technological and governance factors. Conditions for effective implementation
of adaptation and mitigation interventions meanwhile were noted to revolve around
organisation, legal and regulatory aspects, government coordination and a competent
extension service. These elements surfaced in all the sub-studies of this investigation,
prompting policy related proposals around fiscal, institutional and legal/regulatory
benchmarks. Pertinent among others, of such open-ended benchmarks, are proposals for:
promotion of multi-sectorial and multi-stakeholder platforms upstream, and forums
downstream, as high impact governance pathways, facilitated by federating government
bodies for transparent planning, sharing of experiences and harmonization of programs;
creation and support of a carbon knowledgeable extension service to sensitize on carbon
across the forestry, agriculture and energy divide, as well as; a national carbon agency to
regulate and supervise schemes that engage carbon development, accounting and
marketing.

The effect of&nbsp;climate change on threatened forest species and biodiversity in general is discussed, and the associated human
disturbances impacting on the population structure of a threatened species, e.g. Afzelia africana in West Africa, is&nbsp;presented. The important role of non-timber forest products in income generation for the rural communities and&nbsp;the associated challenges of commercialisation is emphasised with examples from two important tree species:&nbsp;shea (Vitellaria paradoxa) and baobab (Adansonia digitata). Finally, the issue covers a people-centred approach&nbsp;in tree planting and management where studies demonstrated that there are still problems of poor participation&nbsp;of local communities due to poor implementation of enabling policies, lack of involvement in initial planning and
subsequent lack of clear benefit-sharing mechanisms.","Chirwa, P. W., Larwanou, M. & Kowero, G.",2017,Journal Article,15892,4/4/2019 7:45,http://afforum.org/sites/default/files/English/English_154.pdf,

Understanding how climate influences society and how humans influence climate has become more urgent now than ever before. Information and knowledge generated and provided by climate change science forms the basis in shaping policies and agreements. The cross-cutting nature of the problems requires the engagement of everyone at all levels. It is therefore important to have some basic understanding of the science of climate change in order to appreciate the seriousness of the problem

Chapter one of the this module explores the science of climate change. This involves a description of the concepts of weather and climate by clearly defining and differentiating between them. The elements of weather and climate are also well analyzed. The difference between the concept of climate variability and climate change is also discussed in detail. In addition, the types, sources and effects of of GHGs are discussed.

Chapter two discusses the causes of climate change. Both natural and human-indiuced drivers of climate change are decribed in detail. Under natural drivers, aspects of volcanic eruptions and wildfire are discussed. Under antropogenic drivers, land use changes, use of fossils fuels and also the urbanization are discussed.

Chapter three examines climate change and ecosystem. The disturbances of ecosystems under climate change are addressed. Various indicators of ecosystem disturbances are explained and also the challenges and opportunities of climate change on ecosystem.

Chapter four focuses on vulnerability to and impact of climate change. Various approaches of vulnerability assessments are discussed and from this chapter it is clear to determine the extent of vulnerability,using socioeconomic or ecological assessments.

Chapter five, finally, discusses the different UN conventions on the envrioment. It is important to note that these conventions play an important role in ensuring that environment is well maintained and protected from human induced actions. They are normally open for participation by the international community as a whole, or by a large number of States.

16172,"International Dialogues, Processes and Mechanisms on Climate Change: A Compendium for Professional and Technical  Training in African Forestry 08","Climate change is a global challenge that requires global solutions as GHG emissions have the same impact on the atmosphere affecting everyone. In this regard, action by one country to reduce emissions will do little to slow global warming unless other countries also act accordingly. This means that effective strategies require commitment and action by all major emitting countries as human activities are contributing to climate change, primarily by releasing large amounts of CO2 and other GHGs into the atmosphere. The initial climate change dialogues were mainly at global level, but in recent times there have been many discussions on mitigation and adaptation that have been initiated at regional and national levels. In 1992, countries joined an international treaty called the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), to jointly consider activities needed to limit average global temperature increases, the resulting climate change, and how to cope with the impacts. By 1995, countries recognised that emission reductions provisions in the UNFCCC were deficient and began negotiations to support global responses to climate change which culminated in the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol (KP) in 1997. The Protocol consists of legally binding emission reduction targets by the developed countries. By 2010, other climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies had emerged to support Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) and the revision of KP.

This module introduces professionals and non-professionals to international dialogues and processes related to climate change, including global, regional, and national level responses to climate change. It also explores the preparedness of the African continent and dialogues, processes and mechanisms to addresses issues of climate change vulnerability, mitigation and adaptation at all levels. For purposes of learning, delivery methods include interactive lectures; group discussions; question and answer sessions; brainstorming and case study activities. Chapter 1 discusses the historical overview of international responses to climate change. Chapter 2 looks at the first multilateral organisations tasked to address climate change, including the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) and United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). Chapter 3 is an overview of the UNFCCC, its objectives, principles, actors and institutional arrangement. Chapter 4 is based on a critical analysis of the KP market-based mechanisms of Emissions Trading (ET), Joint Implementation (JI) and Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). Chapter 5 discusses other strategies for climate change mitigation including REDD+. Chapter 6 discusses Africa’s preparedness and position in climate change negotiations including participation in international and regional initiatives.

16359,The State of Forestry in Africa: Opportunities and Challenges,"This issue provides a broad overview of some of the most pressing concerns in the forestry sector, with the intention that subsequent issues of this publication will dwell on other equally important concerns that could not be accommodated in this issue. AFF plans to produce, with potential partners, such issues once every 2-4 years, resources permitting.

The first chapter explores ways through which SFM can be facilitated to grow on the continent. The actual state of forest resources on the continent is an area that FAO has covered well in its regular publications on the same, so this report does not delve into this. Chapter 2 then looks at how the continent can increase the supply of industrial round wood outside its natural forests by examining the current state, management and supply of germ plasm or planting stock. Following investments in forest and tree establishment in various landscapes is the necessity to protect such investments from pests and diseases, among other vagaries. That is the subject of Chapter 3 that examines the current state, management and control of pests and diseases that afflict forests and tree resources on the continent. Climate change is increasingly bringing another dimension in managing forests and trees outside forests in the sense that a new commercial product, forest carbon, has been introduced to the forestry sector. In addition, climate change is affecting these resources while at the same time these resources affect climate change. This is the focus of Chapter 4. Biofuel development and use on the continent is growing, and this is in tandem with global efforts to develop clean energy through renewable resources. These and other issues are explored in Chapter 5.",AFF,2019,Book,16361,,,

<div class=""field-item even GoogleAnalyticsET-processed"">

There is an increasing recognition of the importance of forest and tree-resources in the social and economic development of African countries. This is because the African forestry sector is currently contributing to reduction of poverty and improving livelihoods among forest dependent people by providing access to forest products such as fuelwood, timber, and non-timber forest products for home consumption and sale. The Forestry sub-sector is a critical driver with regard to enhancing contributions of other sectors of national economies, including agriculture, energy, tourism and water, among others. However, the African forest cover has been declining at a rate of 2.8 million hectares per year from 2010 to 2015; a rate that is much higher than that of other regions in the world. Thus, sustainable forest management is paramount in order to guarantee the sustained contribution of forests to the people of Africa and the environment they live in.

These forests, for various reasons, are experiencing heavy pressure from forest adjacent communities and illegal loggers hence roundwood extractions are under various levels of controls to reduce degradation and enhance biodiversity conservation. The indigenous forests and woodlands are the most extensive and produce wide range of products for various uses including timber and woodfuel, among others. The public sector dominated public plantations remain the main supply of industrial timber in the region, but due to poor management and governance related issues are, in some cases, also experiencing low productivity and losses to other land uses.","Cheboiwo, K.

Methods We compared soil pH, texture, bulk density and SOC and STN contents and stocks (0–100 cm) in natural forest (NF), adjacent shifting cultivation (SC) areas (&gt; 100 years old) having three (SC-3Y), five (SC5Y) and seven (SC-7Y)-year-old fallowing, and 10 year-old mono-cropping field (MCF) converted from shifting cultivation in Western Ethiopia. Results There was no significant difference in soil pH in NF and all shifting cultivation areas. However, MCF had lower soil pH compared to SC-3Y and SC-5Y. There was no or very little difference in soil texture and bulk density across the study sites. Shifting cultivation did not affect SOC and STN stocks. However, conversion of shifting cultivation to mono-cropping decreased SOC (45–50% over 10 years; loss of 11.6 ± 0.2 Mg C ha−1 yr.−1 ) and STN stocks (18–45% over 10 years; loss of 0.6 ± 0.1 Mg N ha−1 yr.−1 ).

17971,Positioning forestry as an entry point and pathway for green economy development in West Africa: African Forest Forum,"This report presents the harmonized and expanded results of studies carried out in 2016 by two teams of researchers on the potential of forests for green economy development in West Africa: the Anglophone study in three sample countries namely: Nigeria, Ghana and The Gambia, and the Francophone study in another three West and Central African countries namely: Niger, Benin and Gabon. The current study also benefits from information obtained from grey sources and the researcher’s experience in West African societies. Although variously defined, United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) describes green economy as low carbon (C), resource-efficient and socially inclusive economy. Forests meanwhile were placed at the center of green economy development in 2009 during the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe /Food and Agriculture Organization (UNECE/FAO) Conference in Geneva, titled “Forest sector in the green economy”. The conference consensually concluded that there was a key role for forests in the transition towards green economy and a more sustainable society. The current study upholds the preceding assertion and proposes to generate verifiable information necessary to increase awareness of policy makers and other actors in West Africa on the role and contribution of forests to the development of a green economy in the sub-region. The study focuses on forests as biological capital for wealth creation, elimination of poverty and stimulation of economic activity. The study identified key elements and proposed how they may be explored to ensure forests’ contribution to green economy development without risking sustainable forest management SFM).

17973,Public and private sector development on forest products industry in Ghana,"This study was commissioned by the African Forest Forum to analyze the nature and trends in primary and secondary forest production in Ghana with emphasis on public and private sector contribution to the development of the sector and organization of production activities. The aim is to strengthen the capacity of the industry to address both social and environmental concerns that contribute to sustainable, equitable and effective private sector development in forestry. The information presented in this report is a synthesis of qualitative and quantitative primary data from interviews of selected forest sector institutions and individuals, augmented with published and grey literature on the forestry sector of Ghana. Forestry contributes 6% to GDP of Ghana and provides livelihoods for about 15% (3.6 million) of the Ghanaian population. Natural forests including tree resources on farmlands are the main sources of supply for timber and non-timber products in Ghana. Over 50 products are extracted from both humid forests and savannah woodlands across the country. The most frequently exploited products for subsistence and commercial purposes include wild foods (mainly game meat, fruits, nuts, mushrooms, snails, etc.) fuelwood, construction materials (timber, poles, rattan, bamboo) and medicines. There are over 27 forest-based enterprises, majority of which are in the small and medium enterprise category, that contribute significantly to local livelihoods and the national economy. The forestry sector of Ghana is characterized by a wide range of public and private sector stakeholders in both primary and secondary forest production. The public sector consists of government institutions primarily responsible for policies, programs, development of resource capacity including technical skill by academic and research institutions for forest management. The private sector constitutes civil society and non-governmental organizations, communities, firms and individuals, among others, engaged in both commercial and non-profit activities involved in advocacy, commerce and other developments in the forestry sector. Private sector contribution to the national economy in the forestry sector has largely been in forest plantation, timber production and processing. The forestry sector contributes 6% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and employs a labour force of over 75,000 people, whilst providing direct livelihood to about two million people. Foreign exchange earning from timber by the end of the third quarter of 2015 was Euro 135 million. Private sector contribution, with respect to the nontimber forest product sector, on the other hand has had minimum official attention, hence not adequately quantified. It has largely been operated by informal or private small and medium scale enterprises using rudimentary technologies whose activities are often unregulated and has hardly been governed by public sector policies and programs.&nbsp;","Obiri, D.

18015,Training needs analysis and forestry curricula evaluation in professional and technical institutions in sub-Sahara Anglophone countries,"Current training needs and emerging trends in the forestry sector have prompted a number of forestry educational institutions to review their traditional curricula in order to produce well equipped graduates. Traditional forestry curricula, as evidenced by the competence profiles of most forestry graduates, comprise gaps between acquired knowledge and skills, on one hand and market needs, on the other hand.
A training needs assessment was undertaken in Sub Sahara African (SSA) Anglophone countries, with the aim of assessing the content of the forestry curricula in professional and technical training institutions in comparison with current market needs and emerging forestry related issues. Primary data and information were collected from employers, research and training institutions through questionnaires. Secondary data and information on historical and existing identified training needs were obtained from literature. Follow up telephone and face-to-face interviews with selected organisations were conducted to ascertain facts as well as filling information gaps.
Institution visits were done for were Bindura University of Science Education (Zimbabwe), National University of Science and Technology (Zimbabwe), Makerere University (Uganda), Sokoine University of Agriculture (Tanzania) and University of Energy and Natural Resources (Ghana). Also, information was obtained from other professional and technical institutions, including University of Stellenbosch (South Africa), University of Ibadan (Nigeria), Malawi College of Forestry and Wildlife (Malawi), Nyabyeya Forestry College (Uganda) and Zimbabwe College of Forestry (Zimbabwe). The target group of forest graduate employers was determined through internet web searches. Employing organisations were categorised as, research institutions, NGOs as well as public/private forestry companies. The survey was conducted on 56 training institutions: comprising 41 universities and 15 colleges, 15 research institutions, 26 forestry public/private organisations and 12 non-governmental organizations.
It was observed that societal expectations of the forest graduate are increasing; demanding that forestry becomes generalist than specialist discipline. It was observed that there is variation in curricula on the same subject area across countries; however, the core forestry courses were covered. Emerging issues found to be deficient in recent forest graduates are on climate change, forest certification, fibre-food-fuels (FFF) nexus, integration of forestry with NRM, and agroforestry. Training institutions have acute shortage of teaching materials especially equipment, current literature and field facilities; some institutions do not have specialised forestry laboratories; there is negligible government and donor support; and ICT facilities are not reliable. It was also observed that earlier established institutions which were supported by FAO/UNDP and donor communities have well developed infrastructure. Unfortunately, the institutions struggle to sustain themselves and the donated equipment at inception is obsolete. Collaborative relations established are still running but are dictated by the donor community or project proponent who may not address local needs. On the other hand, the institutions established by African governments after their independence were never fully equipped and capacitated right from inception and are ill equipped and insufficiently funded. It is recommended that universities set up common interest region-specific satellite campuses as centres of excellence to address research and programmes that address challenges within that particular eco-region given that there are many issues which are of trans-boundary nature, as well as facilitate regional/sub regional economic integration that is fast taking place in Africa whilst the forestry sector lags behind. Training institutions are recommended to collaborate with relevant stakeholders for joint development and review of curricula. Countries may also adopt specialised curricula for women in social and/or community forestry to cover livelihoods and improvement of equal opportunities so as to expand societal potential.","Katsvanga, C.

18018,"Review of land use, land use change and forest sector potential for green economy in Francophone West and Central African countries","This study aimed to assess the green economy potential in the forest sector. It identified and analysed key elements within the forest sector that contribute to green economy, as well as the various parameters that characterise land use and land use changes in three French-speaking African countries (Benin, Gabon, Niger). Data were collected through desk study and field visits in the selected countries.
In each of the selected countries, the forest sector is already playing a leading role in green economy. Indeed, forest trees absorb CO2 emissions, provide resources to local populations, and protect communities from increasingly erratic weather. To make these contributions sustainable, many actions have been undertaken at country level to maintain or increase forest cover. Many afforestation programmes are being implemented and forest management plans have been improved in ways that involve local communities more and increase the benefits they derive from forest resources.
The main causes of deforestation in these countries include agriculture expansion, wood extraction, grazing, hunting and urbanization. None of the countries involved in this study were REDD+ countries at the time of the study; however, the study showed that only Benin expressed interest in being involved in this process while Gabon is opposed to this mechanism. Niger is not opposed to the mechanism and as revealed through this study initiatives are currently underway for the country's involvement in the near future.
All of the three countries have signed many international conventions, action plans and developed very good legislations in the forest sector but their implementation remains limited. To increase forest potential to contribute to green economy there is the need to:
• develop more afforestation programmes with the view to increasing the countries forest cover, and especially so in Benin and Niger;
• consider REDD+, as a strong catalyst for the green economy;
• implement the countries' forest policies and legal frameworks for better local communities’ integration into forest management strategies that can improve their improved well-being;
• enhance efforts on conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity, especially with regard to NTFPs;
• promote payments for environmental and ecosystem services;
• strengthen NTFPs value chains to increase their contribution to people’s well-being; and
• strengthen the capacity of national managerial staff on the concept of green economy and its facets through social and environmental policymaking and how they could integrate the same into national priorities.","Assogbadjo, E.A and Vodouhe, G.F",2019,Report,18020,,,
18146,Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) in the Forestry Sector in Central Africa,"The African Forest Forum (AFF) commissioned this study in four of the ten countries in Central Africa (Cameroon, Democratic Republic of Congo, Gabon and the Republic of Congo) as part of its activities funded by the Swedish International Development Agency (Sida) through a project entitled “Strengthening Sustainable Forest Management in Africa”. The project seeks to generate and share knowledge and information through partnerships in ways that will provide inputs into policy options and capacity building for improved forest management in order to better addresses poverty eradication and environmental protection in Africa. Central Africa is well-endowed with forests, covering 48% of the total land area of 530 million ha. Four countries (Cameroon, Congo, DRC and Gabon) were purposefully selected for this study because together they constitute about 87% of the forest in Central Africa and representing all biophysical landscapes. The methodology for data collection included focus group discussions, interviews with key informants and desk reviews of relevant reports including draft reports that were prepared by national consultants from the 4 selected countries, policy and legislative information related to the sector from various websites and scientific articles. Timber-based and NTFP-based enterprises were targeted to identify stakeholders and beneficiaries, the challenges and the probable future for value addition to forest products and their marketing. Based on the study results some recommendations are proffered to policy makers (specific to forest/product type) and others for further research on public/private partnerships for both processed wood and NTFPs in Central Africa. The results indicate that in Central Africa, six forest management models exist and have their merits and demerits depending on the primary beneficiary (private sector, councils, communities or private individuals) and the socioeconomic focus of national governments to increase stakeholder participation in sustainable forest management or to ensure an increased financial contribution of the forestry sector to the country's GDP. It was observed that forest concessions form the dominant forest management model in Central Africa, with total surface of 7 058 958 ha in Cameroon, 13 685 971 ha in the Republic of Congo, 12 215 659 ha in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and 14 272 630 ha in Gabon. Emphasis is also given on other evolving models of forest management such as community forests, council forests, sale of standing volumes and special permits based on mutual understanding between the public and the private individual or enterprises. In addition to PPPs under production forests in Central Africa, other forms are evolving in protected areas (mostly World Heritage Biospheres sites) in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the Republic of Congo and Chad but with yet immeasurable positive attributes. However, one qualitative positive attribute in the Odzala-Kokoua National Park in DRC is linked to deliberate involvement of other stakeholders such as local communities in the development of ecotourism activities.&nbsp;Also examined is the contribution of the forestry sector to national income and employment as well as national trade balances associated with the export and importation of key wood products. Further analyses are made on trade aspects, in terms of efficiency in flows to various continents, the types of products exported; and finally some recommendations are proffered, including on the need for increased value addition within the countries and further research support for the generation of scientific evidence to support policy decision making.",Tieguhong J.

18149,Public-private-partnerships in the forest sector and sustainable livelihood development in Nigeria,"Public private partnership as a concept has gained ground over the last few decades as a virile approach to delivering goods and services. It is a contractual agreement between a public agency and a private company or consortia of companies whereby the skills and assets of the public and private sectors are shared in delivering a service or facility. This concept has been successfully applied, particularly in infrastructure, as medium to long term arrangements between the public and private sectors in the provision of some service obligations of the public sector by the private sector, with clear agreement on shared objectives for delivery of public infrastructure and/ or public services, as well as benefit sharing. The forest sector had for a long time operated as a public sector concern, with sporadic private involvements. However, in recent years, public-private sector forestry development has emerged as a new world-wide practice for forestry development. The issuance of the World Bank Forest Sector Policy Paper in 1978 also propelled major changes in direction away from support for industrial forestry to forestry that meets local needs. This approach further opened the vistas for private participation in different parts of the world. However, in most cases, there have not been clear arrangements in terms of shared vision and objectives, co-delivery of goods and services as well as cost and benefit sharing. While some advances have been made in Europe, America and parts of Asia in this regard, same may not be said of most of Sub-Saharan Africa, and in particular, Nigeria. The study whose results are shared in this report examined the idea and concept of publicprivate sector partnerships in the forest sector by identifying promising PPP models/approaches for forest compatible sustainable livelihoods development that strengthens the capacity of the industry to address both social and environmental concerns, and therefore contributing to more sustainable, equitable and effective private sector development.This study was undertaken in the High/Moist Forest, Savanna and Sahel zones of Nigeria, and more specifically it was carried out in the selected states of Lagos, Ogun, Oyo, Osun, Edo, Abia, Rivers, Cross Rivers, Niger, Kaduna, Kano and Kwara. The states were further stratified by agro-ecological as well as geo-political settings. Within these settings, study localities were selected across primary forest production, secondary forest production, (wood processing, marketing and trade) including SMEs based on all forest types in the country.&nbsp;","Popoola, L",2017,Working Paper,18151,,,
18499,Public-private-partnerships in the forest sector in Africa: Country Report for Uganda,"Forest resources are of prime importance to the people and economy of Uganda owing to the range of ecological, economic, social and cultural products and services they provide for a multitude of stakeholders. However, forests in the country have declined from 4.9 million hectares in 1990 to an estimated 2.08 million hectares in 2015, although there was a marked increase in the area of planted forests since the early 2000s. Traditionally, forest management in Uganda has been the preserve of government with the private sector predominantly engaged in secondary production and trade in forest products, particularly timber. However, over the past decade, there has been increased participation of the private sector in primary forest production. The national forest policy envisages the private sector to play a central role in managing forests on private land, developing and managing commercial forest plantations, and developing and managing forest products processing industries. This country report is the result of a study conducted in 2015 and 2016 aimed at identifying and promoting public private partnership (PPP) approaches for forest compatible sustainable livelihoods development with the view to strengthen understanding of the key actors in both primary and secondary forestry production in Uganda.

The study was conducted through desk review of extant literature, key informant interviews, and field surveys in selected districts across the country. It involved mapping of key actors in primary and secondary forest production and ascertaining information relating to key products and production, employment, policies and regulations, gender issues, marketing and trade, contribution of private forest sector activities, linkages among actors and the scope of public private partnerships in Uganda’s forest sector.

Findings of the study indicate that there are multiple actors in the sector with the private sector playing an increasingly dominant role in both primary and secondary forest production as government focuses on creating an enabling environment. A variety of tree species are managed in natural forests but P. caribaea and E. grandis are the major species managed in plantations. The planted forest estate approached 90,000ha with an estimated 7 million cubic metres of growing stock. Secondary forest production involved production of various forest products ranging from fuelwood to non-timber forest products. While the primary production sector exhibited appreciable performance, the secondary sector was curtailed by limited supply of round wood. Vertical and horizontal linkages were generally weak with relationships being more informal than formal but emerging players seemed to be pursuing strategies for vertical integration while a section of players in the primary sector made efforts to integrate horizontally. However collaborative arrangements between the public and private sectors have been successfully implemented with appreciable achievements and there is potential for further collaboration for the benefit of the forestry sector. This will help consolidate the achievements so far made, particularly contributions of the private forestry sector such as advocacy, employment generation, social services and value addition to forest produce.",Kambugu Robert Kyeyune,2018,Working Paper,18502,,,
18505,"Review of land use, land use change and forest sector potential for green economy in Anglophone West African countries","Contemporary development trajectories over the years have continued to advance human well-being through phenomenal growth and wealth, never witnessed before in human history. With these advances have emerged environmental impacts that continuously threaten the planet earth. Forests have suffered the most in the course of human development through deforestation for raw material, shelter, infrastructure and food to feed the ever-increasing human population. From all indications, the planet is gradually moving toward exceeding its boundaries. Several initiatives have emerged to address the challenges that have emanated from the global development trajectories. For example, the last two decades have witnessed such initiatives as the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and several international forestry and climate processes. Agreements on the post 2015-development agenda, also known as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have been adopted. In all of these, the concept of green economy continues to feature as an approach that can result in improved human well-being and social equity, while significantly reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities. The forest sector remains crucial to the attainment of the objectives of green economy.

This study investigates the forest sector potential for green economy growth, as well as some aspects of Land Use Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) in Anglophone West African countries of Gambia, Ghana, Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone using a combination of desk work and field studies. Observed drivers of LULUCF in the study area include population growth, agriculture, infrastructure development, uncontrolled and illegal logging. The study also identified some key elements within the forestry sector that contribute to green economy and LULUCF that leave minimal negative impacts on the ecological and social systems, as well as pathways that can enhance green economic growth. They include intensification of crop and livestock agriculture, adoption and strengthening of agroforestry practices, improvements in energy efficiency, improving efficiency in wood harvesting and processing, sustainable harvesting of other forest products, domestication of the supply of non-wood forest products, diversification of livelihood options, reforestation and afforestation initiatives and activities, as well as improved regulation of allocation of land for settlements and infrastructure. Innovative approaches proffered to manage forests for contribution to green economy include: adoption and strengthening of community based forest management, advancing the practice of agroforestry, promotion of sustainable biotrade, promotion of carbon offset markets, adoption of payment for forest environmental services, as well as promotion of forest-based tourism, landscaping and beautification, in addition to adoption of reduced impact logging, and forest certification.

Recommendations are made for improving institutional and regulatory frameworks to facilitate forestry sector contribution to green growth. The key elements of these are improving forest governance and policy re-orientation, reviewing of extant forest laws, adoption of new forestry technologies and training, proper staffing of forestry institutions and agencies, building networks and collaborations with stakeholders, and cross-sectoral engagement. There is also the need to ensure forestry input into national planning. Practicing sustainable forest management in order to secure the full range of forests’ economic, social and environmental contributions is germane to success.",Labode Popoola ,2019,Working Paper,18507,,,
18517,Trans-boundary forest resources in West and Central Africa,"This report presents the results of a study carried out in 2017 through visits to sampled West and Central African countries, namely: Niger, Sierra Leone, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Cameroon. It investigated the challenges of managed trans-boundary forest landscapes of West and Central Africa and perspectives for shared forest ecosystems to integrate this management category. It describes shared forests as, sub-biomes of forests with similar functional ecological processes crossing borders and shared by two or more countries. They are referred by some conservation organizations as ‘ecological regions’, by others as ‘forest hot-spots’ and others as ‘forest conservation heartlands’. The study describes trans-boundary forest management landscapes, different from shared forests, as naturally connected forest areas sustaining similar functional ecological processes, crossing one or more international boundaries that include both protected areas and multiple resource use zones, and involve some form of cooperation in their management. Their objective is to promote land use policies and practices on each side of a border that do not adversely affect ecosystem function and resilience, the composition and persistence of species as well as economic revenues and human survival on the other side of the border (Vasilijević et al. 2015).
Trans-boundary forest landscape management (also trans-boundary forest landscape conservation and management) is an extension of the limited trans-boundary biodiversity protection approach. It fundamentally seeks to improve the chances of forest and biodiversity conservation by extending beyond biodiversity protection to include watershed management, and local economic development through participatory land-use planning for extractive resource zones, and community areas on a larger scale. The approach is characterized by rolling institutional agreements in an adaptive management fashion, extensive land-use planning and sustainable or long term funding through the establishment of trans-boundary forest management trust funds.
The study upholds the results of previous researchers (Wood et al. 2000) that: poverty, population growth, skewed market arrangements and environmentally insensitive policies including their inadequate sector level coordination constitute major pressures and root causes of degradation of trans-boundary forest management landscapes. While the study identified several threats and weaknesses to the sustainable management of such landscapes, the top four, common to both trans-boundary moist forest landscapes and savanna woodlands were: policy differences and problems of collaboration, wildlife related crime and poaching, unplanned cutting of wood and over-exploitation through logging, and incompatible mining and quarries. The report advocates the development of partnerships taking account of political and socioeconomic pressures and threats on the resources of the landscape.","Nganje, m",2018,Report,18518,,https://afforum.org/oldaff/sites/default/files/English/English_219.pdf,

Although 60% of the global working population make their living in the informal sector mostly in low-and middle income countries, the potential for SBMs has rarely been analyzed for this category. This study explores the SBMs of informal charcoal-producing enterprises in coastal Kenya. It describes key business-model components: value proposition, value creation and delivery, and economic value capture. Impact and dependency on sustainability-related indicators were also studied. Data were obtained through individual interviews, focus-group discussions, and workshops for charcoal producers and other relevant stakeholders. Findings demonstrated that charcoal enterprises, despite their informal status, adopt elaborate business models. The incomes positively affect several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by reducing, if not eradicating, poverty and supporting basic livelihood needs. Examples of negative impacts on some SDG include the activity’s contribution to forest degradation. Feedback impacts, where SDG status influence the informal enterprises’ opportunities were also identified. The SBM model contributes to the development of a balanced sustainability transition of the charcoal sector. We suggest further analyses of the role of informal enterprises in the bioenergy sector for sustainable development and how their SBMs could be improved.","Mutta, D.; Mahamane, L.; Wekesa, C.; Kowero, G.; Roos, A.",2021,Journal Article,19013,,https://afforum.org/oldaff/sites/default/files/English/English_220.pdf,
19295,Aboveground and belowground tree biomass and carbon stocks in the miombo woodlands of the Copperbelt in Zambia,"Globally, belowground biomass (BGB) accounts for 20–26% of total biomass, and as such it is an important carbon (C) pool for many vegetation types. However, large uncertainty exists for belowground biomass C compared to aboveground stocks. Using data from 108 destructively harvested trees belonging to 36 miombo species, we estimated root to shoot ratios, and developed models for estimation of aboveground biomass (AGB), BGB and total biomass C stocks in the Copperbelt province of Zambia. We also validated our models using independent datasets from elsewhere in Zambia and Malawi. The C fractions in wood ranged between 51.9 and 58.9%, which was higher than the IPCC default value. The root to shoot ratio was found to be 0.303. The analysis also demonstrated isometric scaling of BGB with AGB. According to cross-validation results, the model that incorporated wood density (ρ), diameter at breast height (D) and total stem height (H) formulated as&nbsp;<em>AGB =0.093(ρD2H)0.97&nbsp;*1.08</em>&nbsp;outperformed existing models developed for the miombo woodlands in Zambia. The best model for BGB was&nbsp;<em>BGB = 0.476(AGB)0.88*1.126</em>. Using the top-ranked models, the stand-level AGB stocks were estimated at 222.2 Mg ha−1, while BGB stocks were estimated at 52.4 Mg ha−1. Aboveground and belowground C stocks were 125.3 Mg ha−1&nbsp;and 29.5 Mg ha−1, respectively. Total biomass C stocks were estimated at 152.1 Mg ha−1&nbsp;or 558.3 Mg ha−1&nbsp;CO2&nbsp;equivalent sequestered in tree biomass.

Miombo Woodland is the major Land use/land cover with important ecological functions in Africa. In Malawi, government-management was designed to manage Woodlands. However, when illegal activities continued, Participatory Forest Management (co-management) in forest reserves was institutionalised for woodland sustainability. Currently, information on co-management mitigating deforestation and degradation is scant. This study assessed woodland/forest through Land use/land cover (LULC) classification across the country (Malawi); compared forest cover within and between strategies using 11 co-management and 12 governmentmanagement forest reserves across the country between 1999 and 2018. Overall accuracies were &gt;90%. Woodland net loses 8.4% (4.39–3.39 million ha) were to Plantation, Grassland and Agriculture transition intensities. Agriculture net gains 9.6% (1.87–3.00 million ha) were from Grassland, Settlement and Woodland transitions for the whole Malawi. Forest cover within co-management and government-management indicated loses. Sustainable management of degraded woodlands, integrated Agriculture and monitoring is encouraged. Further interpretation of transitions is recommended.

Public private partnership as a concept has gained ground over the last few decades as a virile approach to delivering goods and services. It is a contractual agreement between a public agency and a private company or consortia of companies whereby the skills and assets of the public and private sectors are shared in delivering a service or facility. This concept has been successfully applied, particularly in infrastructure, as medium to long term arrangements between the public and private sectors in the provision of some service obligations of the public sector by the private sector, with clear agreement on shared objectives for delivery of public infrastructure and/ or public services, as well as benefit sharing.

After the independence of South Sudan taking about two thirds of the former ‘united Sudan’ forests and against a background of increasing human and livestock population pressure on forest resources, the forest situation in the Republic of Sudan (referred to in this document as Sudan) is pretty bad, and the country is now considered among the least forested countries in Africa. Against this background, and in spite of its important role in maintaining agricultural productivity and providing the firewood and charcoal needs for about 75% of the Sudan’s population, and its potentials for meeting a significant part of industrial wood and non- wood forest products (NWFP’s) for present and future needs, the forestry sector in the country has been seriously neglected and under- funded.

19751,Public and private sector development in forest products industry of South Africa,"South Africa is faced with persistently high levels of poverty and unemployment. Forestry being a rurally based activity is ideally placed to contribute towards wealth generation and job creation in neighbouring communities. Commercial timber growing is highly regulated for environment and water conservation reasons. The forest estate currently covers 1 265 811 hectares of highly productive exotic plantations. The resource is currently being underutilized with a reported annual harvest of 18.5 million m3 in 2012/13 compared to a sustainable annual yield of 26 .4 million m3. Pulp, paper and board manufacture dominate the industry, accounting for 70% of the roundwood intake in 2012/13. This sector however is currently only operating at 81% capacity. The forest products industry is export based and in nominal terms earned the country US$ 1.67 billion. Imports amounted to US$ 1.24 billion resulting in a positive balance of payments of US$ 0.43 billion. The Forestry Sector Charter initiative undertaken in terms of the government’s Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment legislation has been negotiated and implemented with the objective of bringing about greater participation of black people, and particularly women, in the forestry value chain. The result of this initiative is that opportunities are being created for the rural poor who border on forest plantation estates. The development is discussed and a model that is evolving is presented. An additional 140 000 hectares of land has been identified for further new afforestation. This land is communally owned and both licencing and community involvement is required in order for this afforestation to take place. A successful project in southern KwaZulu-Natal serves as a model for such an undertaking. However, further expansion of the area requires that a co-ordinated effort be made by companies, government, non-government organisations, rivals, and communities in order to capture the economic benefits on offer. Individual private timber growers in South Africa are well organised and successfully market their timber co-operatively. This co-operative model and its achievements are well documented. The initiative affords members the ability to achieve economies of scale and access to down-stream processing. A similar arrangement is evolving in the non-timber forest products sector where a micro-franchising model is discussed, and a broader application proposed. Processor growers keen to secure further raw material are entering into out-growers’ agreements with small timber growers. This relationship is regulated in terms of a code of conduct negotiated and agreed within the Forestry Sector Charter.",Dobson D.,2018,Report,19754,,https://afforum.org/oldaff/sites/default/files/English/English_230.pdf,

The development of an organised private sector in forestry, including the identification and promotion of Public Private Partnership (PPP) models for all-inclusive, forest compatible development and sustainable livelihoods support can potentially revive the Zimbabwean economy which has been affected by hyperinflation, among other factors. In terms of private sector development, Zimbabwe had nurtured a vibrant and organised forest plantation system until 2000. The sector is regulated by the Forestry Commission and the Timber Producer’s Federation (TPF). The TPF ensures that best practices are adopted.

19784,The Future of Food: Domestication and Commercialization of Indigenous Food Crops in Africa over the Third Decade (2012–2021),"This paper follows the transition from ethnobotany to a deeper scientific understanding of the food and medicinal properties of African agroforestry tree products as inputs into the start of domestication activities. It progresses on to the integration of these indigenous trees as new crops within diversified farming systems for multiple social, economic and environmental benefits. From its advent in the 1990s, the domestication of indigenous food and non-food tree species has become a global programme with a strong African focus. This review of progress in the third decade is restricted to progress in Africa, where multi-disciplinary research on over 59 species has been reported in 759 research papers in 318 science publications by scientists from over 833 research teams in 70 countries around the world (532 in Africa). The review spans 23 research topics presenting the recent research literature for tree species of high priority across the continent, as well as that in each of the four main ecological regions: the humid zone of West and Central Africa; the Sahel and North Africa; the East African highlands and drylands; and the woody savannas of Southern Africa. The main areas of growth have been the nutritional/medicinal value of non-timber forest products; the evaluation of the state of natural resources and their importance to local people; and the characterization of useful traits. However, the testing of putative cultivars; the implementation of participatory principles; the protection of traditional knowledge and intellectual property rights; and the selection of elite trees and ideotypes remain under-researched. To the probable detriment of the upscaling and impact in tropical agriculture, there has been, at the international level, a move away from decentralized, community-based tree domestication towards a laboratory-based, centralized approach. However, the rapid uptake of research by university departments and national agricultural research centres in Africa indicates a recognition of the importance of the indigenous crops for both the livelihoods of rural communities and the revitalization and enhanced outputs from agriculture in Africa, especially inWest Africa. Thus, on a continental scale, there has been an uptake of research with policy relevance for the integration of indigenous trees in agroecosystems and their importance for the attainment of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. To progress this in the fourth decade, there will need to be a dedicated Centre in Africa to test and develop cultivars of indigenous crops. Finally, this review underpins a holistic approach to mitigating climate change, as well as other big global issues such as hunger, poverty and loss of wildlife habitat by reaping the benefits, or ‘profits’, from investment in the five forms of Capital, described as ‘land maxing’. However, policy and decision makers are not yet recognizing the potential for holistic and transformational adoption of these new indigenous food crop opportunities for African agriculture. Is ‘political will’ the missing sixth capital for sustainable development?","Leakey, R.R.B.; Tientcheu Avana, M.-L.; Awazi, N.P.; Assogbadjo, A.E.; Mabhaudhi, T.; Hendre, P.S.; Degrande, A.; Hlahla, S.; Manda, L.",2022,Journal Article,19785,,https://afforum.org/oldaff/sites/default/files/English/English_232.pdf,

This study was aimed at producing information that will be used by relevant stakeholders in facilitating the development of public-private sector partnerships in forestry involved in value addition to wood and non-wood forest products in Southern African region; specifically for five countries: Madagascar, Mozambique, South Africa, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Also, the study identifies promising public-private partnership (PPP) models/approaches for forest compatibility with sustainable livelihoods that addresses both social and environmental concerns and contribute to more sustainable, equitable and productive private sector development. The contribution of the forestry sector to livelihood support and national economy is significant. Forestry sector contributes to the country’s GDP varying from 0.8% (South Africa) to 5.7% (Zambia). The industry has considerable potential for employment and incomes at different levels. In total, in the Southern African region, there was estimated a total of 125 366 employees in primary forest production and 602 966 charcoal producers. In secondary forest production, the number of employees was estimated at 78 186. Since Madagascar, Mozambique and Zambia depend on indigenous forests for their wood products supply they are facing similar concerns. There are various wood and non-wood tree species of commercial importance whose stocks are declining. This underlines the need to manage the forest resources sustainably. Most of the forest resources in these countries are owned by the government. Actors in secondary forest production are mainly small and medium scale enterprises (SMEs) and large companies in the private sector; most of them are in the informal sector. In South Africa and Zimbabwe, most of the commercial forest estate is in private ownership (83% in South Africa). Landowners have property rights and full control over the land and forest resources on it, with limited statutory prohibitions such as felling of indigenous trees and land use changes. In Zimbabwe, the forest sector had had a history of primary and secondary growth, but capacity utilization fell below 20% resulting from power cuts, inadequate competent staff, and obsolete manufacturing plants. Actors are dominated by men, even though women are also increasing their participation in the sector. There is a government’s initiative in South Africa called B-BBEE that can be used as inspiration to the four other countries to effectively address the issue of participation of women in the forest sector, but factors that constrain success of the program should be considered. There is good potential in the Southern African region, for increased public-private partnerships in the forestry sector. There are several successful PPP models relative to community forestry, community afforestation, value addition in primary and secondary processing, leasing and concession. However, supporting measures are needed, like: (i) sustainable management of forest resources, (ii) land tenure security, (iii) promotion of associations of private companies in order to defend/articulate the interests of the members, (iv) strengthening of the private investment environment in the forest sector, (v) strengthening of ties between organizations, companies and communities in order to link with emerging markets, (vi) providing incentives for the creation of PPPs in the production, (vii) value addition and marketing of forest products and (viii)empowerment of stakeholders in PPP negotiation, and promotion of benefit sharing system.

The African Forest Forum (AFF) celebrated, in May 2019, ten years of its active work on African forestry. Since its establishment in December 2006, AFF developed project activities and obtained funding for them with the actual work starting in 2008. The activities targeted improving livelihoods of the people of Africa and the environment they live in through the sustainable management and wise use of tree and forest resources on the African continent. AFF is a people centred institution, and advocates for wise use forest and tree resources to improve peoples’ livelihoods and national economies in an environmentally friendly manner.&nbsp;As a build-up to the 10th anniversary event, AFF conducted a survey between November and December 2018 to track access, uptake and use of the information and knowledge products the institution generated and shared over this ten-year period (2008 – 2018). In addition, the survey also sought to identify ways for improving AFF communication tools with the aim of increasing the uptake, use and impact of its knowledge products.

20110,The Sustainable Forest Management Framework for Africa (2020-2030),"Extending over 624 million hectares (ha), covering 20.6 percent of the continent’s land area and representing 15.6 percent of the world’s forest cover, Africa’s forests have a unique role in contributing to the attainment of the aspirations of the Agenda 2063, the Africa We Want. This is a picture of a prosperous continent with the means to drive its own development through the sustainable, long-term stewardship of its resources.

African forests are crucial at regional and global scales for maintaining environmental quality and stability. They provide globally important ecosystem services and are indispensable for the achievement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals including SDG1, SDG2, SDG 13, SDG14 and SDG15. Furthermore, Sustainable Forest Management also contributes towards the realization of the global objectives of the United Nations Forum on Forests and those of other global and regional forest related frameworks and instruments.",African Union Commission,2020,Book,20111,,https://afforum.org/oldaff/sites/default/files/English/English_235.pdf,
20322,Strengthening capacity of African stakeholders to  integrate and uptake forest and farm tree-based adaptation and mitigation options in  response to climate change in Anglophone and Lusophone Africa,"The vulnerability of rural households to climate change in Africa is caused by exposure to climate variability and extreme weather events and by a combination of social, economic and environmental factors that interact with climate change. There is growing evidence that climate change is affecting forests resources in Africa. The effect on the forest resource is mainly as a result of vulnerable communities adapting to climate change through the use and in some cases over use of the forestry goods and services. Since the Kyoto Protocol and several COP Agreements, the role of forestry and trees in a landscape in general in addressing climate change through mitigation and adaptation has gathered pace. This was initially through the promotion of conservation of forests and woodlands as a means of reducing emissions especially carbon dioxide. However, there is increasing understanding that there is an intrinsic link between people and the forest landscape as forests go beyond safety net in addressing the livelihoods of communities in proximity as well as ecosystem services including climate change. The appreciation of forest-based interventions to address climate change adaptation and mitigation has gained attraction; and has been identified by the IPCC including trees in a multifunctional landscape. As a result, a number of donor funded development programme and projects were initiated in Africa response of climate change.","Chirwa, P",2020,Working Paper,20323,,https://afforum.org/oldaff/sites/default/files/English/English_236.pdf,
20324,Strengthening capacity of forestry  stakeholders to integrate and uptake forest and tree-based climate change adaptation  and mitigation options in francophone African countries,"Forests and trees provide huge opportunities for African countries to respond to their post-2020 climate change mitigation and adaptation commitments. The contribution of forests and/or trees to mitigation and adaptation depends on how they are incorporated in policies, strategies and actions, and the integration could depend on the choice and capacity of stakeholders. There is a gap in information and knowledge on the uptake of integrated forest and tree-based mitigation and adaptation options in addressing climate change in Africa. Generating such information and knowledge in terms of identifying challenges and opportunities is relevant for stakeholders to enhance the uptake of forest and tree-based mitigation and adaptation options into policies and actions. Thus, the necessity of this study covering francophone African countries. This study profiles promising forest-based and on farm tree-based mitigation and adaptation policies, strategies and actions, assesses the determinants of choice of strategies and actions as well as levels of successes in addressing climate change and climate variability. In addition, this study aims to evaluate the external environment, including policies, legislation, incentives, that have implications on the implementation of these promising adaptation and mitigation activities, and makes attempt to propose a framework for integrating forest and tree-based adaptation and mitigation options in francophone African countries.","Chia, E., Fobissie, K",2020,Working Paper,20325,,https://afforum.org/oldaff/sites/default/files/English/English_237.pdf,

The study undertook an in-depth analysis that could provide information to enhance national forest governance to respond to the Paris Agreement (PA) and related global climate change policies and initiatives in Central and West Africa. Specifically, this study assessed forest governance and national forest sector contribution to NDCs in West and Central African countries. The study used context and policy analysis of existing literature from secondary data from Central and West Africa, which was triangulated with primary data collected from the field. The study covered selected case study countries including the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Republic of Congo, Cameroon, Mali, Gambia, Liberia, and Benin. A total of 48 respondents were interviewed as illustrated in Figure 1. Primary data were collected through interviews (face-to-face and email).

Such instruments include: (i) the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (UNCBD), the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Fauna and Flora (CITES), the RAMSAR Convention on Wetlands, and the UN Forest Instrument. Under the Paris Agreement and associated NDCs, national forest- based solution to climate change could be enhanced through more effective implementation of (i) REDD+, and good practices of (ii) Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF). Despite a plethora of forest-related policies and legislation that need to synergize with contemporary regional and international frameworks, national forest governance is relatively weak in Southern and Eastern Africa. These regions have not adequately integrated policy and strategy implementation. Besides, there are poor technical capacities to direct policy and programme implementation among stakeholders. Issues of gender and vulnerable groups are not sufficiently mainstreamed to sustainable forest management.

The overall goal of the project is “to generate and share knowledge and information through partnerships in ways that provide inputs into policy and decision-making options and capacity building, for improved forest management that better addresses poverty eradication and environmental protection in Africa”. One of the key project objectives is to identify and promote opportunities for protecting and sustainably managing the forest resource base of the continent as well as the supply of its ecosystem’ goods and services. The consultancy assignment of which this report is part of is titled: “Assessment of forest planning and management in different forest types in selected African countries”. The purpose of the study is to evaluate ways for improving forest planning and forest management in selected countries in Anglophone and Lusophone Africa with the aim to enhance the supply of forest ecosystem goods and services. This particular report covers only some select countries from Anglophone and Lusophone Africa.

The specific objectives of the study are: On forest planning: a) Evaluate the planning processes found in forest types in the selected countries and; b) Evaluate the adequacy of the plans in terms of accuracy/reliability and adequacy of information used, tools /techniques/models used for planning and for moving the forest to a desired future structure, adequacy of knowledge and skills for their development, sensitivity to gender considerations, inclusiveness of related sectors, constraints in planning and ways to contain them. On forest management: c) Evaluate institutions implementing forest management; d) Assess human, financial and physical resources available for forest management; (e) Assess the extent of compliance to plans by implementing institutions, constraints experienced and how to overcome them and; f) Evaluate the state of management of the forest types in the selected African countries.

A total of 28 Anglophone and Lusophone countries were covered in this study. Field work was conducted in selected forests in Angola, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The methodology involved two aspects: (1) literature review to source secondary information and data; (2) field work. Both aspects were guided by a checklist of guiding questions that were derived to cover the details necessary to fulfil the objectives of the study. Data and information from literature review and field work was summarized into tables and charts.",Emmanuel F.

20514,Sustainability of land management  approaches and practices applied in  Eastern African forests,"The African Forest Forum (AFF) has implemented a project on “Strengthening management and use of forest ecosystems for sustainable development in Africa”. The project aimed to sustainably
manage forest resources in Africa in a way that enhances ecosystem goods and services through sustainable land management (SLM) approaches and practices. In respect to mangrove forests,
which receive particular attention in this report, the overall aim was to assess SLM approaches and practices in order to inform the adoption of land use systems that enable land users to maximize the economic, social, and ecological benefits from the land while protecting mangrove ecosystems in the Eastern Africa. Specifically, the following tasks were implemented: (i) to identify and document land management approaches and practices, including policies, institutions and legal measures guiding them, applied in mangrove forest areas; (ii) to assess the sustainability of promising land management approaches and practices identified under no. 1 above; (iii) to evaluate the potential of the identified land management approaches and practices under no. 2 above, in terms of their compatibility with (a) the development of forests and (b) protection of forests and (c) development and protection of trees outside forests; (iv) to assess the extent to which forest stakeholders are incorporating the identified SLM approaches and practices in their forest plans and activities; (v) to assess gender roles in protecting forest lands and adoption of appropriate SLM approaches and practices in mangrove forests; and (vi) to identify institutional, policy, legal mechanisms, and other aspects that can be employed to enhance protection of mangrove forest lands in the study areas. Data for the study were specifically collected in three countries: Kenya, Mozambique and Tanzania. Data were collected through focus group discussions, household questionnaire, key informant interviews, participant observations and literature review. Quantitative data were analyzed using Excel and Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) and presented in frequency distribution tables and graphs. Content analysis was used to analyze qualitative data. Sustainable Land Management (SLM) approaches and practices applied by farmers adjacent to mangrove forests consist of conservation measures such as agronomic, vegetative, structural and management measures. They were applied on farms to address land problems related to soil fertility mining, soil erosion, loss of biodiversity, compaction/ soil sealing and crusting, salinity, water degradation, soil pollution and climate variability. Own innovations, contact farmers, field visits, Farmer Field School (FFS), Participatory Forest Management (PFM), meetings, and demonstration plots were the approaches used to promote best SLM practices. Selection of the best practices and approaches in the Eastern African countries has based on specific land degradation problems. The Eastern Africa countries have a range of policies which are relevant in the promotion of SLM approaches and practices. It is important to note that not all SLM activities are best practices and those that are technically effective or suitable for one specific site/location are not necessarily the best option for other sites/locations with different biophysical constraints and socio-economic contexts. The best practices are characterized by being profitable, cost-efficient, easy to learn, socially and culturally accepted, effectively adopted and taken up, environmentally friendly, and are appropriate for all stakeholders. Sustainability of SLM approaches and practices was determined by assessing their effectiveness, efficiency, relevance, ethical soundness, level of community involvement, partnership and collaboration, political commitment, sustainability, and replication and adoption.",Rukia Kitula,2022,Working Paper,20515,,https://afforum.org/oldaff/sites/default/files/English/English_243.pdf,
20516,"Developing circular economy in  Eastern Africa through liquid  biofuels: cases of Ethiopia, Kenya  and Tanzania","The African Forest Forum (AFF) has undertaken studies in four African sub-regions to assess the potential of selected African countries to produce and use of liquid biofuels
as a strategy for developing green and circular economies. The sub regions are eastern, southern, central and western Africa. This report is on three eastern Africa countries namely of Ethiopia, Kenya and Tanzania. Then the outputs of this study are expected to facilitate planning the growth and development of local and national liquid biofuel sector based on information and data obtained from field and factory visits, interviews and discussions with some national government and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), and other stakeholders related to the liquid biofuel industry. Liquid biofuels commonly available in eastern Africa are bioethanol and biodiesel produced from higher plants, though there was ongoing research on liquid biofuel from microalgae. In Ethiopia, land highly suitable for production of feedstock was estimated that 7.2 million ha (6.3%) for jatropha, 7.68 million ha (6.8%) for croton, 11.47 million ha (10.2%) for cassava, 40.91 million ha (36.2%) for sweet sorghum, and 0.7 million ha (0.62%) for sugarcane. In Kenya, 17.4 million ha (30.6%) land area was suitable for sweet sorghum, 6.39 million ha (11.2%) for cassava, 1.26 million ha (2.2%) for sugarcane, and 14.9 million ha (26.2%) for jatropha. In Tanzania, the suitable land area is 22.79million ha (22.9%) for cassava, 18.96million ha (21.5%) for sugarcane, 31.51million ha (35.8%) for sweet sorghum, and 17.78million ha (20.2%) for sunflower.
Investments in liquid biofuel production in the years 2010s were not profitable, resulting in investors abandoning investments on feedstocks like jatropha and related biodiesel crops. The only investment that remained was the already well-known sugarcane production mainly for sugar and molasses bioethanol. The use of sugarcane for the production of biofuels has been observed in13 sugar factories in Ethiopia, 16 sugar factories in Kenya, and five sugar factories in Tanzania. The reported annual production of ethanol was 24.25 million litres in Ethiopia, 8.25 million in Kenya and 1.4 million in Tanzania from one or two sugar factories. Improving productivity of sugarcane by increasing the yield to 138 tons or more per hectare, combined with improvement in technology by reducing wastage in molasses, and ethanol production, could enable the existing Ethiopian sugarcane factories to produce in full capacity at 108 billion litres of ethanol per year, and those in the Kenyan at 72 billion litres/year and the ones in Tanzanian at 20 billion litres/year, when operating on an average of 250 working days/year. The production costs for conventional liquid biofuels are mainly the feedstock costs that account for 60-90% of the total production cost. This has given rise to the use of cheap sources such as lignocellulosic biomass waste, agricultural residues, and sugarcane bagasse. These were reported to vary annually from about 2.2 million tons of agricultural residues in Kenya, to 19.7 million tons in Ethiopia, in addition to 24.2 million tons of woody biomass residues in Kenya to 105.2 million tons in Ethiopia that could be used for lignocellulosic bioethanol production. From lignocellulosic biomass processing, the total bioethanol production could reach 8.2 billion liters/year in Kenya, 10.8 billion liters in Tanzania to 35.7 billion liters/year in Ethiopia, which is higher than their imports of petroleum.",Miftah F.
